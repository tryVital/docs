Junction Team is a **regional** resource. All data of the Team are stored in the region you selected. This
cannot be changed afterwards. Make sure you choose a region that is suitable to your data residency requirements.

| Regions | Data Residency                                     |

Your Junction Org is a **global** resource â€” you can start with a Team in one region and create more in a different
region as you expand.
