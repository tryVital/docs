You use Junction API to:

* manage users, demographics information and device connections in your Team with the [Core API](/api-reference/user/create-user);
* pull ingested device data and inspect backfill progress through the [Data Access API](/api-reference/data/sleep/get-summary);
* order lab tests, manage appointments and pull the results through the [Lab Testing API](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order); and
* aggregate ingested device data with the [Horizon AI Query API](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-one);

<Info>
For managing Team configuration and Org resources programmatically, see [Junction Management API](/api-details/junction-management-api).

## Environments

Junction provides two Sandbox environments and two Production environments today:

| Environment      | Base URL                                  | Team API Key Prefix    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Production US    | `https://api.us.junction.com/`         | `pk_us_*`
| ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Production EU    | `https://api.eu.junction.com/`         | `pk_eu_*`
| ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Sandbox US       | `https://api.sandbox.us.junction.com/` | `sk_us_*`
| ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Sandbox EU       | `https://api.sandbox.eu.junction.com/` | `sk_eu_*`

<Note>
If you are using a `*.tryvital.io` Base URL, they are still supported alongside `*.junction.com`.
</Note>

Sandbox environments are functionally identical to Production environments, except that:

1. Each Team can have only up to 50 Users in Sandbox;
1. You can create [Synthetic Device connections](/wearables/providers/test_data) connections; and 
1. You can [simulate and transition an order through its lifecycle](/lab/overview/sandbox). 


## Authentication

Junction API accepts **Team API Key**. You can provision a Team API Key through:

1. the Team Config page in the [Junction Dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io); or
2. the [Create Team API Key](api-reference/org-management/team-api-keys/create-team-api-key) endpoint of the
   [Junction Management API](/api-details/junction-management-api).

Your API requests should present the Team API Key under the `X-Vital-API-Key` header. For example:

```bash cURL
curl --request GET
  --url 'https://api.tryvital.io/v2/providers'
  --header 'X-Vital-API-Key: <YOUR-TEAM-API-KEY>'
```

<Note>
A [Management Key](/api-details/junction-management-api) used by Junction Management API does not function as Team API Key.
However, you can manage Team API Keys through a Management Key.

## Junction Mobile SDKs

[Junction Mobile SDKs](/wearables/sdks/) supports two authentication methods:

Scheme | Authorization | Recommended use case
------ | ------------- | ---------------------
[Sign-In Token](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) | User-scoped access    | Production mobile apps
[Team API Keys](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-api-keys)      | Full Team data access | Proof-of-concept

Refer to the [Mobile SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication) documentation for more information.
