title: 'Rate Limiting'
---

Junction does not impose a per-customer rate limit on server-to-server API calls at this time.

However, you may occasionally encounter **429 Too Many Requests** or **503 Service Unavailable** from our infrastructure.
You should be prepared to retry your API requests with a reasonable exponential backoff strategy.


## Targeted rate limits

You may encounter **429 Too Many Requests** in the these specific scenarios:

| Endpoint                                    | Authentication Scheme | Rate Limit                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `POST /user/refresh/{user_id}`              | Vital API Key         | 8 per hour per user         |

<Note>
Junction may adjust rate limiting based on real-world usage patterns. We will give you sufficient notices
if a new enforcement would impact your existing usage patterns.
