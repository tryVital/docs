## Environments

There is one production environment for Junction Management API:

| Environment      | Base URL                              | Management Key Prefix    |

## Authentication

Junction Management API accepts **Management Key**. Enterprise customers can request a Management Key
through your Junction Customer Success manager.

Your API requests should present the Management Key under the `X-Management-Key` header. For example:

```bash cURL
curl --request GET
  --url "https://api.management.junction.com/v1/org/${ORG_ID}"
  --header 'X-Management-Key: ${YOUR_MANAGEMENT_KEY}'
```

<Note>
A [Team API Key](/api-details/junction-api#authentication) does not work with Junction Management API.

Junction enforces the use of separate API credentials based on the principle of least privilege, especially
considering the administrative power of Junction Management API.
