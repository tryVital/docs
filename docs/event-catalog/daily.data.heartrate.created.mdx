description: "New heartrate discrete samples have been created"
---
<Warning>
Each sample is uniquely identified by a triple key (3-tuple) comprising of its resource type name,
its source (ID or slug) and its timestamp. e.g., `(heartrate, fitbit, 2023-01-23T12:34:56Z)`.

If multiple samples are received at the same triple key, the last sample received replaces all its
previous versions.
</Warning>
