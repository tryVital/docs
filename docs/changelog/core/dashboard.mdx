### Improved Order Search experience (Aug 2024)

We have improved the search and filtering capabilities in the Orders page, helping you quickly locate specific orders and information.

<Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

#### Basic filters

Order searching now supports these filtering criteria: 

- Patient or Recipient (in the case of at-home kits) — First or Last name
- Patient Email
- Patient Date of Birth
    - in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - e.g., “1988” will filter for all patients born in 1988.
    - e.g., “1988-03” will filter for all patients born in March of 1988 and “1988-03-07” will filter for all patients born on March 7th, 1988.
- User ID
- Client User ID
- Order ID
- Order Status

<Info>
Only one Basic filter can be active at any given time. This is because Basic filters are
mutually exclusive with each other.
</Info>

### Date filters

On top of the basic filters, you can now filter by date range based on either:

- the Order Creation date 
    - For scheduled tests, the order creation date is considered instead of the scheduled date.

- the Order Last Updated date
    - This allows you to filter orders based on the date at which the order status was last updated.

Dates are currently filtered with respect to the UTC timezone.

### Status filters

Filter based on the most recent status of the order. Note that some statuses are unique to a collection modality such as Mobile Phlebotomy or Self-Collected Test Kits.
    
<Info>
You can apply multiple Status filters at the same time. These stack as a logical OR among themselves.
</Info>

### Order Type filters

Filter based on the order type: At-Home Phlebotomy, Walk-In Test, At-Home Test Kit.

<Info>
You can apply multiple Order Type filters at the same time. These stack as a logical OR among themselves.
</Info>

### Activation Type filters

Filter for:

1. Scheduled Orders that would not begin execution until the specified target date; or
2. Current Orders that have been executed and are being fulfilled.

</Accordion>


### Improved User Search and Introspection experience (Jun 2024)

The Users page in the Vital Dashboard is now a search-first experience with more filtering and sorting options
available. You can now also click on specific users to inspect device connection status and the patient details.

<Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

Find your user by typing their Client User ID or Vital User ID into the search bar. For lab testing users: Name, Email and Phone Number are also supported.

Click on a user to reveal the new User Details page:


#### The General tab

Shows an overview of all patient details and user settings associated with the Vital User ID.

#### The Connections tab

Provides device connection availability and data ingestion insights of the Vital User.

You can also obtain this same information programmatically through the [Introspection API](/api-reference/introspection/user-resources).

</Accordion>
