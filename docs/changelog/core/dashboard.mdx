### Improved Order Search experience (Aug 2024)

We have improved the search and filtering capabilities in the Orders page, helping you quickly locate specific orders and information.

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone">
  #### Basic filters

  Order searching now supports these filtering criteria:

  - Patient or Recipient (in the case of at-home kits) — First or Last name
  - Patient Email
  - Patient Date of Birth
    - in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - e.g., “1988” will filter for all patients born in 1988.
    - e.g., “1988-03” will filter for all patients born in March of 1988 and “1988-03-07” will filter for all patients born on March 7th, 1988.
  - User ID
  - Client User ID
  - Order ID
  - Order Status

  <Info>
    Only one Basic filter can be active at any given time. This is because Basic filters are
    mutually exclusive with each other.
  </Info>
  ### Date filters

  On top of the basic filters, you can now filter by date range based on either:

  - the Order Creation date
    - For scheduled tests, the order creation date is considered instead of the scheduled date.
  - the Order Last Updated date
    - This allows you to filter orders based on the date at which the order status was last updated.

  Dates are currently filtered with respect to the UTC timezone.

  ### Status filters

  Filter based on the most recent status of the order. Note that some statuses are unique to a collection modality such as Mobile Phlebotomy or Self-Collected Test Kits.

  <Info>
    You can apply multiple Status filters at the same time. These stack as a logical OR among themselves.
  </Info>
  ### Order Type filters

  Filter based on the order type: At-Home Phlebotomy, Walk-In Test, At-Home Test Kit.

  <Info>
    You can apply multiple Order Type filters at the same time. These stack as a logical OR among themselves.
  </Info>
  ### Activation Type filters

  Filter for:

  1. Scheduled Orders that would not begin execution until the specified target date; or
  2. Current Orders that have been executed and are being fulfilled.
