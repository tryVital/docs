### Lab Test Result Interpretation Filtering (June 2025)

You can now filter lab test orders by result interpretation using the new `interpretation` query parameter in the [GET /orders](/api-reference/lab/orders/get-orders) endpoint.

<Accordion icon="filter" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

The new filtering capability allows you to query orders based on their clinical interpretation:

**Query Parameter:**
- **`interpretation`** - Filter by result interpretation of the lab test
  - Type: `enum<string> | null`
  - Available options: `normal`, `abnormal`, `critical`
  - Note: This enum is non-exhaustive

**Response Enhancement:**
Order responses now include a new `interpretation` field providing the clinical assessment of the test results:

- **`interpretation`** - Interpretation of the order result
  - Type: `enum<string> | null` 
  - Available options: `normal`, `abnormal`, `critical`
  - Note: This enum is non-exhaustive

This enhancement enables you to programmatically identify and prioritize critical lab results, improving clinical workflow efficiency and patient care monitoring.

Check out the [GET /orders](/api-reference/lab/orders/get-orders) endpoint documentation.

### Webhook Management Endpoints (May 2025)

- **CRUD** (create/read/update/delete) your webhooks
- Manage webhook **headers**
- Update webhook **secrets**

### Team Management Keys (May 2025)

[Junction Management API](/api-details/junction-management-api) now supports Management Keys (previously _Org Keys_) that
are scoped to one or more Teams.

As a recap, there are now two types of Management Keys:

| Type                | Remarks                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Org Management Key  | Full control of the organization — notably can create or delete Teams.                                                        |
| Team Management Key | Scoped control over one or more Teams. But it cannot access Org-level resources or actions, e.g., creating or deleting Teams. |

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="key" iconType="duotone">
  All Management Keys — Org or Team — are accepted by the `X-Management-Key` header, as well as the deprecated `X-Vital-Org-Key` header.

  Selected customers can now manage Management Keys in the [Junction Dashboard](https://app.junction.com/) through:

  | Type                | Remarks                                                                    |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Org Management Key  | The **Org Config** page; accessible via the top-left corner Dropdown Menu. |
  | Team Management Key | The **Team Config** page.                                                  |

  - the [Create Management Key](/api-reference/org-management/management-keys/create-management-key) endpoint documentation;
  - the [List Management Keys](/api-reference/org-management/management-keys/list-management-keys) endpoint documentation; and
  - the [Delete Management Key](/api-reference/org-management/management-keys/delete-management-key) endpoint documentation.

  <Note>
    If you intend to create a Team Management Key that binds to 2 or more Teams, you must use the
    [Create Management Key](/api-reference/org-management/management-keys/create-management-key) API endpoint. Junction Dashboard does not
    support creating a key for more than one Team.
  </Note>
  <Note>
    Note that Management Keys cannot be used as Team API Keys to access the Junction API. However, you can
    [manage Team API Keys](/api-reference/org-management/team-api-keys/create-team-api-key) through a Management Key.

### `X-Management-Key` header for Junction Management API (April 2025)

[Junction Management API](/api-details/junction-management-api) now accepts Management Keys (previously _Org Keys_)
in the `X-Management-Key` header, in addition to the `X-Vital-Org-Key` header.

We would continue to support the `X-Vital-Org-Key` header. Though we recommend moving over to `X-Management-Key` to avoid
confusion, especially if you do plan to adopt Team Management Keys.

### Enhanced Historical Data Pull Status Tracking (May 2025)

### Prepare Team Custom Credentials endpoint (Aug 2024)

You can use the information to configure things like OAuth callback URI and the Webhook URI (if applicable), before activating it on your
Vital Team through the [Set Team Custom Credential](/api-reference/org-management/team-custom-credentials/upsert-team-custom-credentials)
endpoint.

### Vital Orgs and Org Management API (Apr 2024)

We have introduced Vital Org, a new level that groups all your Vital Teams. Your Vital Teams have been
transparently grouped and migrated to the new structure.

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="building" iconType="duotone">
  We introduced this to provide a unified billing and administrative experience for customers having these use cases:

  1. multi-region presence; or
  2. user organization with diverging team-level configurations.

  We introduced the Org Management API because customers have asked for the programmatic access to
  dyanmically create Vital Teams and manage different aspects of their Vital Teams.

  <Info>
    Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
  </Info>

### New webhook event top-level fields (Mar 2024)

All events now include Team ID, User ID and Client User ID as top-level fields.

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="message" iconType="duotone">
  We introduced this because this helps reduce a Vital User ID -\> Client User ID database lookup on your end.

  Check out the [Webhook Event Structure](/webhooks/event-structure) documentation.

  #### Before

  ```json Basic event structure
  {
    "data": {
      # ... event specific data
    },
    "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
  }
  ```

  #### After

  ```json Basic event structure
  {
    "data": {
      # ... event specific data
    },
    "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
    "user_id": "4a29dbc7-6db3-4c83-bfac-70a20a4be1b2",
    "client_user_id": "01HW3FSNVCHC3B2QB5N0ZAAAVG",

### Improved error response for User creation conflicts (Mar 2024)

The [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint has improved handling of
conflicts in Client User ID.

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="duotone">
  We introduced this because the user creation endpoint being idempotent can help
  simplify your application logic.

  When the supplied `client_user_id` conflicts with an existing user, the 400 Bad Request response
  now includes the Vital User ID (`user_id`) and the creation date (`created_on`) of the conflicting user.

  Check out the [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>
