### Vital Orgs and Org Management API (Apr 24)
We have introduced Vital Org, a new level that groups all your Vital Teams. Your Vital Teams have been
transparently grouped and migrated to the new structure.

<Accordion icon="building" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduced this to provide a unified billing and administrative experience for customers having these use cases:

1. multi-region presence; or
2. user organization with diverging team-level configurations.


We introduced the Org Management API because customers have asked for the programmatic access to
dyanmically create Vital Teams and manage different aspects of their Vital Teams.

<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management) documentation.

### New webhook event top-level fields (Mar 24)

All events now include Team ID, User ID and Client User ID as top-level fields.

<Accordion icon="message" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduced this because this helps reduce a Vital User ID -> Client User ID database lookup on your end.

Check out the [Webhook Event Structure](/webhooks/event-structure) documentation.

#### Before
```json Basic event structure
{
  "data": {
    # ... event specific data
  },
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
}
```

#### After
```json Basic event structure
{
  "data": {
    # ... event specific data
  },
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
  "user_id": "4a29dbc7-6db3-4c83-bfac-70a20a4be1b2",
  "client_user_id": "01HW3FSNVCHC3B2QB5N0ZAAAVG",
  "team_id": "6b74423d-0504-4470-9afb-477252ccf67a"

### Improved error response for User creation conflicts (Mar 24)

The [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint has improved handling of
conflicts in Client User ID.

<Accordion icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduced this because the user creation endpoint being idempotent can help
simplify your application logic.

When the supplied `client_user_id` conflicts with an existing user, the 400 Bad Request response
now includes the Vital User ID (`user_id`) and the creation date (`created_on`) of the conflicting user.

Check out the [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>


### User Undo Deletion (Feb 24)

You can now undo user deletion that is still in the 7-day grace period.

<Accordion icon="trash-undo" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [User Undo Deletion](/api-reference/user/undo-delete-user) endpoint documentation.
