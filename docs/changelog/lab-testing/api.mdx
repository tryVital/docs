### Enhanced Lab Order Management with Result Interpretation Filtering (June 2025)

We've enhanced the Orders page with new filtering and visualization capabilities for lab test result interpretations, making it easier to identify and prioritize critical patient results.

<Accordion title="Details" defaultOpen icon="filter" iconType="duotone">
  ## What's New

  - **Interpretation Filter** – Filter orders by clinical result interpretation using the new "Interpretation" dropdown filter
  - **Critical Value Indicators** – The orders table now displays visual indicators for orders with critical results
  - **Enhanced Order Details** – Order detail views now include interpretation badges highlighting critical findings

  ## Filter Options

  The new Interpretation filter allows you to quickly locate orders based on their clinical assessment:

  - **Normal** – Orders with results within normal reference ranges
  - **Abnormal** – Orders with results outside normal ranges but not critically urgent  
  - **Critical** – Orders with results requiring immediate clinical attention

  ## Visual Enhancements

  ### Orders Table
  - Critical value indicators help you quickly spot high-priority results that need immediate attention
  - Clear visual distinction between normal, abnormal, and critical interpretations

  ### Order Details View
  - Prominent badges display the interpretation status for easy identification
  - Critical results are highlighted with distinctive styling to ensure they don't go unnoticed

  <Info>
    You can combine the Interpretation filter with existing filters like Order Status, Date Range, and Order Type for more precise result filtering.
  </Info>

  This enhancement improves clinical workflow efficiency by enabling healthcare teams to quickly identify and prioritize orders requiring immediate attention.

### Introducing Panel Renaming & Archiving (May 2025)

We’ve added more control to how you manage test panels.

<Accordion title="Details" icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="regular">
  Now you can skip the support email and work directly in the Test Catalog to:

  - Rename panel names
  - Archive outdated or unused panels to keep things clean
  - View archived panels using the "Status" filter and "unarchive" to make panels active again

  Existing orders tied to archived panels will remain active and processable.

### Problem in Transit Order Statuses (Mar 2025)
Testkit orders now support two new statuses representing problems in transit. Refer to the [lab test lifecycle documentation](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle).

<Accordion icon="billboard" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We’re introducing two new statuses for the `OrderLowLevelStatus` enum (`problem_in_transit_lab` and `problem_in_transit_customer`) and two for the `OrderStatus` enum (`collecting_sample.testkit.problem_in_transit_customer` and `collecting_sample.testkit.problem_in_transit_lab`)—and we may make further changes in the future. To ensure future compatibility, we ask that you avoid exhaustive matching on enum values. Code that assumes all current values are exhaustive could break or fail to compile with SDK upgrades.

Here’s how to verify and ensure you benefit from future enhancements:

1. Look for areas in your code where you take an action based on the values of a Junction-defined enum. For example, you might have Python code like this:

```python Python
match status:
    case OrderStatus.TESTKIT_ORDERED:
        handle_ordered()
    case OrderStatus.TESTKIT_AWAITING_REGISTRATION:
        handle_awaiting_registration()
        # other cases...
```

2. Check unknown values in your code paths are handled gracefully—for example, by using default cases. Logging unknown values can help you stay informed.

```python Python
match status:
    # previous cases...
    case unknown_status:
        logger.warning(f"Unknown status received: {repr(unknown_status)}")
```

3. Make sure you’re running the latest version of our SDK.

4. You’re good to go. Once you’ve checked the code paths won’t break if Junction-defined enums start including new values, no further action is needed.
