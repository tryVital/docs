### Apple HealthKit data sync improvements (Aug 24)

An overhauled Apple HealthKit sync engine is now available across all Vital Mobile SDK platforms.
The changes bring historical data sync incrementality, prioritization, network resiliency and reduced resource usage.

<Accordion icon="apple" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

1. Most resources now use a resumable sync & upload process.

    * This enables the SDK to make constant forward progress, especially when you have specified a very large historical pull stage (60-365 days)
      through the [Team Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences) API.

2. The SDK now prioritises syncing of summary types over timeseries data.

    * During the historical pull stage, all timeseries resources would be suppressed until all the summary types have been successfully uploaded.

    * After the historical pull stage, the SDK would make forward progress on summary types, before it proceeds to deal with the more CPU-time consuming timeseries data that are more prone to operating system throttling.

3. With an updated iOS App Target configuration, the SDK would now self-register as a `BGProcessingTask` or `BGHealthResearchTask` (iOS 17+) to the iOS BackgroundTasks framework.

    * This would provide the SDK an additional opportunity to complete any resource sync that is not able to complete during normal HealthKit background delivery.

    * Please refer to the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#1-setup-app-entitlements) on how to update your iOS App Target configuration in Xcode.

### Menstrual Cycle Tracking (July 24)

Menstrual cycle tracking data can now be collected through the Apple HealthKit and Android
Health Connect integrations.

<Accordion icon="venus" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Ask for data permission on the `MenstrualCycle` resource from the user through the Vital Health SDK.

Check out the [Get Menstrual Cycles](/api-reference/menstrual-cycle/get-summary) endpoint and
the [Menstrual Cycle data events](/event-catalog/daily.data.menstrual_cycle.created) in the Event Catalog
for more information.
</Accordion>


### Steps count in workouts (May 24)

Workouts now include the total steps count during the session (if available).

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Get Workouts](/api-reference/workouts/get-summary) endpoint and
the [Workout Created](/event-catalog/daily.data.workouts.created) event for more information.

### New Abbott LibreView integration (May 24)

Vital has introduced an new Abbott LibreView provider (`abbott_libreview`). It uses password authentication,
accepting LibreView patient account credentials.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
This is an alternative option to our practice-based Freestyle Libre provider (`freestyle_libre`).

With `abbott_libreview`, Vital uses the provided LibreView patient account credentials to connect directly
to LibreView. There is no involvement of a LibreView practice in this integration.

Note that both practice-based and patient-based connections would continue to be supported in parallel. The
`abbott_libreview` integration does not replace the `freestyle_libre` integration.

Check out the [Abbott LibreView / Freestyle Libre](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview) guide for more information.
</Accordion>


### Removed Fitbit and Oura required scopes (May 24)

The Fitbit profile scope and Oura email scope are no longer required for establishing connections.

For Fitbit specifically, please be aware of the [updated Fitbit Time Zone resolution precedences](/wearables/guides/fitbit#time-zone-resolution). When
your user refuses to grant both the activity and the profile scope, Fitbit data are more likely be timestamped incorrectly in UTC time basis
due to inaccurate or unavailable time zone information.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We have now updated our Fitbit and Oura integrations not to depend on these scopes to be **minimally functional**.

If you are interested in requiring your users to grant certain scopes when connecting an OAuth provider, check out the
[Team Scope Requirements](/changelog/wearables/api#team-scope-requirements-apr-24) changelog entry and
the [Set Team Scope Requirements](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/get-team-scope-requirements) endpoint for more information.

### Freestyle Libre: India region (Apr 24)
Our Freestyle Libre integration now supports the LibreView India region.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Freestyle Libre](/wearables/guides/freestyle#custom-practice-enterprise-only) documentation for more information.
