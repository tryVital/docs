### Health SDK: Explicit Connect mode (Sep 2025)

The Health SDK now supports an opt-in **[Explicit Connect mode](https://docs.junction.com/wearables/sdks/health/connection-policies#explicit-connect-mode)**, which enables your application to
explicitly control the moment of Health Connect connection creation and disconnection.

<Accordion icon="heart" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
The opt-in Explicit Connect mode also allows remote disconnection through the [Deregister Connection](https://docs.junction.com/api-reference/user/deregister-a-provider) endpoint, which was not supported in the default [Auto Connect](https://docs.junction.com/wearables/sdks/health/connection-policies#auto-connect-mode-default) mode.

If your device connection management UX is built upon an explicit notion of connecting and disconnecting Apple HealthKit and Health Connect
connections — as if they are like their cloud-based counterparts — you might find the [Explicit Connect](/wearables/sdks/health/connection-policies#explicit-connect-mode)
mode more appealling.

Check out the [Health SDK Connection Policies](/wearables/sdks/health/connection-policies) documentation for further details.

<Note>
This feature is available on iOS SDK 1.8.0+, Android SDK 4.2.0+, React Native SDK 5.4.0+ and Flutter SDK 4.6.0+.

### Health Connect sync progress logs in Junction Dashboard (Sep 2025)

Health Connect integrations using Android SDK 4.2.0 or above would now report client-side sync progress regularly to the Junction Dashboard.

<Accordion icon="heart" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Similar to the iOS SDK equivalent, this report would include metadata of any exception that had disrupted a sync attempt. We hope that this
brings more visibility into Health Connect sync issues.

<Note>
This feature is available on Android SDK 4.2.0+, React Native SDK 5.4.0+ and Flutter SDK 4.6.0+.

### Improved LibreView practice connection process (Jan 2025)

You can now connect LibreView patients in to [46 regions in the EU environment](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview#vital-eu-region)
and [8 regions in the US environment](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview#vital-us-region).

<Accordion icon="link" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Previously, the Link API and Link Widget listed only the regions to which our practice account was registered. However, these
practice accounts can often connect to patients in a larger geographical area beyond the region of registration. For example,
patients in most EMEA countries can connect through our Netherlands practice account.

Therefore, we have now changed:

1. Link Widget to display an exhaustive list of regions which our practice account can reach; and
2. Link API to accept any ISO 3166-1 code that is on the list.

In other words, say if you have a patient domiciled in Belgium, it is no longer necessary to teach them to choose "Netherlands" when
connecting through the Link Widget. They can now intuitively choose "Belgium" when asked by the Link Widget.

Check out the [Abbott LibreView](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview) guide and
the [Connect Email Provider](/api-reference/link/link-email-provider) endpoint
for more information.

### Sleep Cycle Summary Type (Nov 2024)

We are introducing a new Sleep Cycle summary type (`sleep_cycle`) which captures the detailed hypnogram of a sleep session.
The existing hyponogram timeseries type is deprecated in favour of this new summary type.

<Accordion icon="moon" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Get Sleep Cycle](/api-reference/data/sleep-cycle/get-summary) endpoint and
the [Sleep Cycle data events](/event-catalog/daily.data.sleep_cycle.created) in the Event Catalog
for more information.
</Accordion>


### Body Summary model extension (Nov 2024)

The Body Summary model now includes 4 new fields:
 * `water_percentage` - The percentage of water in the body.
 * `muscle_mass_percentage` - The percentage of muscle mass in the body.
 * `visceral_fat_index` - Provider's score of visceral fat levels.
 * `bone_mass_percentage` -  The percentage of bone mass in the body.

At the time of writing all four are only available from the Withings provider.

<Accordion icon="chart-scatter" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Get Body Summary](/api-reference/body/get-summary) endpoint and
the [Body Created](/event-catalog/daily.data.body.created) event for more information.
</Accordion>

### Sleep Type (Nov 2024)

New Sleep summaries now have a new _Sleep Type_ field.

<Accordion icon="moon" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

Vital maps the Sleep Type from the source provider whenever possible. If this is unavailable at source,
Vital infers the Sleep Type based on the sleep session duration.

Sleep Type         | Description
------------------ | -----------------
`long_sleep`       | &gt;=3 hours of sleep
`short_sleep`      | &lt;3 hours of sleep
`acknowledged_nap` | User-acknowledged naps, typically under 3 hours of sleep
`unknown`          | The sleep session recording is ongoing.

Check out the [Get Sleep endpoint](/api-reference/data/sleep/get-summary) and the [Sleep data events](/event-catalog/daily.data.sleep.created)
in the Event Catalog for more information.

### Apple HealthKit data sync improvements (Aug 2024)

An overhauled Apple HealthKit sync engine is now available across all Vital Mobile SDK platforms.
The changes bring historical data sync incrementality, prioritization, network resiliency and reduced resource usage.

<Accordion icon="apple" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

1. Most resources now use a resumable sync & upload process.

    * This enables the SDK to make constant forward progress, especially when you have specified a very large historical pull stage (60-365 days)
      through the [Team Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences) API.

2. The SDK now prioritises syncing of summary types over timeseries data.

    * During the historical pull stage, all timeseries resources would be suppressed until all the summary types have been successfully uploaded.

    * After the historical pull stage, the SDK would make forward progress on summary types, before it proceeds to deal with the more CPU-time consuming timeseries data that are more prone to operating system throttling.

3. With an updated iOS App Target configuration, the SDK would now self-register as a `BGProcessingTask` or `BGHealthResearchTask` (iOS 17+) to the iOS BackgroundTasks framework.

    * This would provide the SDK an additional opportunity to complete any resource sync that is not able to complete during normal HealthKit background delivery.

    * Please refer to the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#1-setup-app-entitlements) on how to update your iOS App Target configuration in Xcode.

| Platform       | Release Note |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Native iOS     | [vital-ios 1.2.2](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-ios/releases/tag/1.2.2) |
| Flutter        | [vital-flutter 4.2.1](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-flutter/releases/tag/vital_health-v4.2.1) |
| React Native   | [vital-react-native 4.2.1](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-react-native/releases/tag/4.2.1) |

</Accordion>


### Menstrual Cycle Tracking (July 2024)

Menstrual cycle tracking data can now be collected through the Apple HealthKit and Android
Health Connect integrations.

<Accordion icon="venus" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Ask for data permission on the `MenstrualCycle` resource from the user through the Vital Health SDK.

Check out the [Get Menstrual Cycles](/api-reference/menstrual-cycle/get-summary) endpoint and
the [Menstrual Cycle data events](/event-catalog/daily.data.menstrual_cycle.created) in the Event Catalog

### New Abbott LibreView integration (May 2024)

Vital has introduced an new Abbott LibreView provider (`abbott_libreview`). It uses password authentication,
accepting LibreView patient account credentials.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
This is an alternative option to our practice-based Freestyle Libre provider (`freestyle_libre`).

With `abbott_libreview`, Vital uses the provided LibreView patient account credentials to connect directly
to LibreView. There is no involvement of a LibreView practice in this integration.

Note that both practice-based and patient-based connections would continue to be supported in parallel. The
`abbott_libreview` integration does not replace the `freestyle_libre` integration.

Check out the [Abbott LibreView / Freestyle Libre](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview) guide for more information.
</Accordion>


### Removed Fitbit and Oura required scopes (May 2024)

The Fitbit profile scope and Oura email scope are no longer required for establishing connections.

For Fitbit specifically, please be aware of the [updated Fitbit Time Zone resolution precedences](/wearables/guides/fitbit#time-zone-resolution). When
your user refuses to grant both the activity and the profile scope, Fitbit data are more likely be timestamped incorrectly in UTC time basis
due to inaccurate or unavailable time zone information.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We have now updated our Fitbit and Oura integrations not to depend on these scopes to be **minimally functional**.

If you are interested in requiring your users to grant certain scopes when connecting an OAuth provider, check out the
[Team Scope Requirements](/changelog/wearables/api#team-scope-requirements-apr-24) changelog entry and
the [Set Team Scope Requirements](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/get-team-scope-requirements) endpoint for more information.
