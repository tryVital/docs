Menstrual cycle tracking data can now be collected through the Apple HealthKit and Android

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

### New Abbott LibreView integration (May 24)

Vital has introduced an new Abbott LibreView provider (`abbott_libreview`). It uses password authentication,
accepting LibreView patient account credentials.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
This is an alternative option to our practice-based Freestyle Libre provider (`freestyle_libre`).

With `abbott_libreview`, Vital uses the provided LibreView patient account credentials to connect directly
to LibreView. There is no involvement of a LibreView practice in this integration.

Note that both practice-based and patient-based connections would continue to be supported in parallel. The
`abbott_libreview` integration does not replace the `freestyle_libre` integration.

Check out the [Abbott LibreView / Freestyle Libre](/wearables/guides/abbott-libreview) guide for more information.

### Removed Fitbit and Oura required scopes (May 24)

The Fitbit profile scope and Oura email scope are no longer required for establishing connections.

For Fitbit specifically, please be aware of the [updated Fitbit Time Zone resolution precedences](/wearables/guides/fitbit#time-zone-resolution). When
your user refuses to grant both the activity and the profile scope, Fitbit data are more likely be timestamped incorrectly in UTC time basis
due to inaccurate or unavailable time zone information.

<Accordion icon="tag" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We have now updated our Fitbit and Oura integrations not to depend on these scopes to be **minimally functional**.

If you are interested in requiring your users to grant certain scopes when connecting an OAuth provider, check out the
[Team Scope Requirements](/changelog/wearables/api#team-scope-requirements-apr-24) changelog entry and
the [Set Team Scope Requirements](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/get-team-scope-requirements) endpoint for more information.
