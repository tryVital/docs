### The `is_final` flag in `historical.data.*.created` events
<Warning>The removal will happen on or after **15 April 2024**.</Warning>

We are removing the `is_final` flag from the Historical Pull Completed (`historical.data.*.created`) events.

For each resource, Vital now signals one Historical Pull Completed event, only after we have finished fetching
all data chunks. This means `is_final` no longer has a meaning, since the event itself is *final*.

<Card title="Recommended Action">
Stop parsing `is_final` as a required field when processing `historical.data.*.created` events.
