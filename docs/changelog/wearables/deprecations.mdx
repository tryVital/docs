### Redefining Source and Provider

<Warning>The stated removals in this section will happen on or after **31 July 2024**.</Warning>

Vital has redefined what _Source_ and _Provider_ means across our API and event schemas:

<Accordion title="The new definitions of Provider and Source">

| Entity   | Definition               |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Source   | The source context of a specific summary or a specific timeseries value group. | 
| Provider | A wearable data provider (an app, a platform, a service, or Vital Mobile SDKs). |

A _Source_ context comprises of:
* the Provider (slug only)
* the [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type)
* the [App ID](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#app-id) (_optional_)

We have also plans for the _Source_ context to include source device metadata where available.

A _Provider_ object is a short description of a wearable data provider. It comprises of the familiar
`name`, `logo` and `slug` trio you have been receiving in many data events.

</Accordion>

To migrate to the new definitions, Vital is announcing the following deprecations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="All Data Dvents (daily.data.*)" stepNumber="1" titleSize="p">
    Inside the Source context located at `$.data.source`, the `name`, `logo`, and `slug` fields are
    now deprecated.

    Vital no longer embeds these _Provider_ object fields in every data event, except for the provider
    slug.

    Using the [Steps data event](/event-catalog/daily.data.steps.created) as an illustration, originally
    the `source` field describes the wearable data provider:
    ```json daily.data.steps.created (Original)
    {
        "event_type": "daily.data.steps.created",
        "data": {
            "data": [...],
            "source": {
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://example.com/oura.svg"
            }
        },
        "user_id": "fb58770e-8b7b-4416-a5bd-8433786d10dc"
    }
    ```

    As part of this redefinition, the `source` field is redefined to mean the _Source_ context of this steps timeseries
    value group. So Vital has introduced a few new _Source_ context fields:

    ```json daily.data.steps.created (Current)
    {
        "event_type": "daily.data.steps.created",
        "data": {
            "data": [...],
            "source": {
                "provider": "oura",
                "type": "ring",
                "app_id": null,

                /** BEGIN: deprecated Provider fields **/
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://example.com/oura.svg"
                /** END: deprecated Provider fields **/
            }
        },
        "user_id": "fb58770e-8b7b-4416-a5bd-8433786d10dc"
    }
    ```

    Once the deprecation cycle ends, Vital will remove the deprecated fields:

    ```json daily.data.steps.created (Future)
    {
        "event_type": "daily.data.steps.created",
        "data": {
            "data": [...],
            "source": {
                "provider": "oura",
                "type": "ring",
                "app_id": null
            }
        },
        "user_id": "fb58770e-8b7b-4416-a5bd-8433786d10dc"
    }
    ```

    <Card title="Recommended Action" icon="lightbulb-exclamation-on">

    * Get Sleep: `GET /v2/summary/sleep/*`
    * Get Workouts: `GET /v2/summary/workouts/*`
    </Note>

    Similar to changes to the Data Events, the `name`, `logo`, and `slug` sub-fields under the `source` field
    in each and every summary are now deprecated.

    Vital no longer embeds these _Provider_ object fields in every summary, except for the provider
    slug.

    Using the [Get Profile endpoint](/api-reference/profile/get-summary) as an illustration, originally
    the `source` field describes the wearable data provider:
    ```json Profile (Original)
    {
        "id": "eadba0c7-4e81-4d17-962c-9ebe0629c08f",

        },
        "user_id": "71937dd3-aebe-46b7-ab64-c287bd75b2a6"
    }
    ```

    As part of this redefinition, the `source` field is redefined to mean the _Source_ context of this Profile
    summary. So Vital has introduced a few new _Source_ context fields:

    ```json Profile (Current)
    {
        "id": "eadba0c7-4e81-4d17-962c-9ebe0629c08f",
        "date": "2022-08-04",
        "height": 183,
        "source": {

    Once the deprecation cycle ends, Vital will remove the deprecated fields:

  <Step title="Provider Connection events" stepNumber="3" titleSize="p">

    <Note>
    This applies to:
    * Provider Connection Created: `provider.connection.created`.
    </Note>

    Vital has renamed the `source` field in this event to `provider`, aligning with the redefinition of _Source_
    and _Provider_.

    To illustrate the change, originally the `source` field describes the wearable data provider:
    ```json provider.connection.created (Original)
    {
        "event_type": "provider.connection.created",
        "data": {
            "source": {
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://logo_url.com"
            },
            "user_id": "71937dd3-aebe-46b7-ab64-c287bd75b2a6",
            "resource_availability": {...}
        }
    }
    ```

    As part of this redefinition, `source` is no longer applicable here. Vital has introduced an identical
    `provider` field as its replacement.

    ```json provider.connection.created (Current)
    {
        "event_type": "provider.connection.created",
        "data": {
            "provider": {
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://logo_url.com"
            },
            "user_id": "71937dd3-aebe-46b7-ab64-c287bd75b2a6",
            "resource_availability": {...},

            /** BEGIN: deprecated field **/
            "source": {
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://logo_url.com"
            }
            /** END: deprecated field **/
        }
    }
    ```

    Once the deprecation cycle ends, Vital will remove the deprecated `source` field:

    ```json provider.connection.created (Future)
    {
        "event_type": "provider.connection.created",
        "data": {
            "provider": {
                "name": "Oura",
                "slug": "oura",
                "logo": "https://logo_url.com"
            },
            "user_id": "71937dd3-aebe-46b7-ab64-c287bd75b2a6",
            "resource_availability": {...}
        }
    }
    ```

### The `is_final` flag in `historical.data.*.created` events

<Warning>The removal will happen on or after **31 June 2024**.</Warning>

We are removing the `is_final` flag from the Historical Pull Completed (`historical.data.*.created`) events.

For each resource, Vital now signals one Historical Pull Completed event, only after we have finished fetching
all data chunks. This means `is_final` no longer has a meaning, since the event itself is *final*.

<Card title="Recommended Action" icon="lightbulb-exclamation-on">
Stop parsing `is_final` as a required field when processing `historical.data.*.created` events.
