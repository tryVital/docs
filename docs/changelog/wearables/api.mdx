### Vital Sign-In Token for Mobile SDKs

Vital Sign-In Token is a new, user-scoped Authentication scheme for Vital Mobile SDKs.

<Accordion icon="id-badge" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
It grants only user-scoped access to your mobile app sign-ins. This allows you to keep your Vital API Keys
as server-side secrets.

We encourage all customers using Vital API Keys in their production mobile apps to
migrate to the Vital Sign-In Token scheme.

Check out the [SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) guide on how to migrate to
this scheme. Check out the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint documentation
on how to generate tokens for your mobile app sign-ins.
