### Understanding Resource Availability (Apr 24)
When a user connection to a provider is established, the webhook event now includes a resource availability
report of the connection.

<Accordion icon="signal-bars" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
This report is based on the permissions *(also known as API access scopes)* the user has granted during
the authentication process.

In some cases, a provider resource may be available, but some information could be absent due to
some optional scopes having been denied by the user. The availability report includes a full breakdown
of granted and denied scopes by their optionality.

<Note>
If the provider has no concept of API access scopes, we report all resources as available.
</Note>

You can also query this information at any time through the
[Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint.

Check out the [Provider Connection Created](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created)
(`provider.connection.created`) event schema and the [Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint documentation.

</Accordion>


### Updating your Team Brand Information (Apr 24)
You can now manage Brand Information of your Vital Teams through the Org Management API.

<Accordion icon="billboard" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
Team Brand Information is used in:

1. the Vital-hosted [Link widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/introduction);
2. all user communications [Vital Lab Testing](/lab/overview/introduction) sent on your behalf; and
3. the Vital-hosted Appointment Booking page for [Vital Lab Testing](/lab/overview/introduction).


<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Update Team](/api-reference/org-management/team/update-team) and 
[Create Team](/api-reference/org-management/team/create-team) endpoint documentation.

</Accordion>

### Vital Orgs and Org Management API (Apr 24)
We have introduced Vital Org, a new level that groups all your Vital Teams. Your Vital Teams have been
transparently grouped and migrated to the new structure.

<Accordion icon="building" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
We introduced this to provide a unified billing and administrative experience for customers having these use cases:

1. multi-region presence; or
2. user organization with diverging team-level configurations.


We introduced the Org Management API because customers have asked for the programmatic access to
dyanmically create Vital Teams and manage different aspects of their Vital Teams.

<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management) documentation.

</Accordion>

### New webhook event top-level fields (Mar 24)

All events now include Team ID, User ID and Client User ID as top-level fields.

<Accordion icon="message" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
We introduced this because this helps reduce a Vital User ID -> Client User ID database lookup on your end.

Check out the [Webhook Event Structure](/webhooks/event-structure) documentation.

#### Before
```json Basic event structure
{
  "data": {
    # ... event specific data
  },
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
}
```

#### After
```json Basic event structure
{
  "data": {
    # ... event specific data
  },
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
  "user_id": "4a29dbc7-6db3-4c83-bfac-70a20a4be1b2",
  "client_user_id": "01HW3FSNVCHC3B2QB5N0ZAAAVG",
  "team_id": "6b74423d-0504-4470-9afb-477252ccf67a"
}
```

### Improved error response for User creation conflicts (Mar 24)

The [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint has improved handling of
conflicts in Client User ID.

<Accordion icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
We introduced this because the user creation endpoint being idempotent can help
simplify your application logic.

When the supplied `client_user_id` conflicts with an existing user, the 400 Bad Request response
now includes the Vital User ID (`user_id`) and the creation date (`created_on`) of the conflicting user.

Check out the [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>


### User Undo Deletion (Feb 24)

You can now undo user deletion that is still in the 7-day grace period.

<Accordion icon="trash-undo" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
Check out the [User Undo Deletion](/api-reference/user/undo-delete-user) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### Fallback Birth Date for Heart Rate Zones
You can now set a Fallback Birth Date on a user.

<Accordion icon="cake-candles" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
Vital can use this to compute a more accurate workout Heart Rate Zones, when the provider
exposes neither heart rate zones nor user age to Vital.

Check out the [Heart Rate Zones](/wearables/providers/heart-rate-zones#fallback-birth-date) documentation.
</Accordion>

### Grouped Timeseries (Feb 24)
You can now get grouped timeseries data.

<Accordion icon="chart-scatter" iconType="duotone" title="Details">

This initial release groups data by [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type)
from [supported providers](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#supported-providers).

Check out the [Blood Oxygen](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/blood-oxygen) endpoint documentation for an example.
</Accordion>


### Historical Pull Introspection (Dec 23)
You can now introspect the status of all one-off user historical data pulls.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
It also provides the pulled date-time range, as well as a rough estimate of the amount of
data ingested (in terms of "days with data").

Check out the [Historical Pull Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### User Resources Introspection (Dec 23)
You can now introspect user data ingestion statistics.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
For example, the endpoint provides:

1. Oldest and newest data timestamp
2. The number of objects sent in `*.created` events
3. The status and time of the last ingestion attempt (polling or push)

Check out the [User Resources Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>


### Vital Sign-In Token for Mobile SDKs (Nov 23)

Vital Sign-In Token is a new, user-scoped Authentication scheme for Vital Mobile SDKs.

<Accordion icon="id-badge" iconType="duotone" title="Details">
It grants only user-scoped access to your mobile app sign-ins. This allows you to keep your Vital API Keys
as server-side secrets.

We encourage all customers using Vital API Keys in their production mobile apps to
migrate to the Vital Sign-In Token scheme.

Check out the [SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) guide on how to migrate to
this scheme. Check out the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint documentation
on how to generate tokens for your mobile app sign-ins.
