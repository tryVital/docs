### Understanding Resource Availability (Apr 24)
When a user connection to a provider is established, the webhook event now includes a resource availability
report of the connection.

<Accordion icon="signal-bars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduce this because this helps you understand what resources would and would not be available on
a new connection. We also provide insights into how partial consents from users during the OAuth authentication
flow can influence the resource availability, so that you can take actions accordingly.

This resource availability report is based on the permissions *(also known as API access scopes)* the user has
granted during the authentication process.

In some cases, a provider resource may be available, but some information could be absent due to
some optional scopes having been denied by the user. The availability report includes a full breakdown
of granted and denied scopes by their optionality.

<Note>
If the provider has no concept of API access scopes, we report all resources as available.
</Note>

You can also query this information at any time through the
[Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint.

Check out the [Provider Connection Created](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created)
(`provider.connection.created`) event schema and the [Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint documentation.

### Fallback Birth Date for Heart Rate Zones
You can now set a Fallback Birth Date on a user.

<Accordion icon="cake-candles" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Vital can use this to compute a more accurate workout Heart Rate Zones, when the provider
exposes neither heart rate zones nor user age to Vital.

Check out the [Heart Rate Zones](/wearables/providers/heart-rate-zones#fallback-birth-date) documentation.
</Accordion>


### Grouped Timeseries (Feb 24)
You can now get grouped timeseries data.

<Accordion icon="chart-scatter" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

This initial release groups data by [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type)
from [supported providers](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#supported-providers).

Check out the [Blood Oxygen](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/blood-oxygen) endpoint documentation for an example.
</Accordion>


### Historical Pull Introspection (Dec 23)
You can now introspect the status of all one-off user historical data pulls.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
It also provides the pulled date-time range, as well as a rough estimate of the amount of
data ingested (in terms of "days with data").

Check out the [Historical Pull Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### User Resources Introspection (Dec 23)
You can now introspect user data ingestion statistics.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
For example, the endpoint provides:

1. Oldest and newest data timestamp
2. The number of objects sent in `*.created` events
3. The status and time of the last ingestion attempt (polling or push)

Check out the [User Resources Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>


### Vital Sign-In Token for Mobile SDKs (Nov 23)

Vital Sign-In Token is a new, user-scoped Authentication scheme for Vital Mobile SDKs.

<Accordion icon="id-badge" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
It grants only user-scoped access to your mobile app sign-ins. This allows you to keep your Vital API Keys
as server-side secrets.

We encourage all customers using Vital API Keys in their production mobile apps to
migrate to the Vital Sign-In Token scheme.

Check out the [SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) guide on how to migrate to
this scheme. Check out the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint documentation
on how to generate tokens for your mobile app sign-ins.
