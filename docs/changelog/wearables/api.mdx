### Introducing Universal Group By Support to Horizon AI Query (June 2025)

<HorizonAIBeta />

Horizon AI Query can now group and aggregate the data by any [Table Column expression](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/column-expressions#table-column-expression)
and/or any [Source Column expression](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/column-expressions#source-column-expression).

This gives you more options on how the data should be dissected — not just by calendar units, but now also by Data Source fields and categorical values from the
data itself.


<Accordion icon="link" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

Check out the [Group By clause](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/group-by-clause) documentation.

<Note>
If both the _Provider_ and _Source Type_ Source Columns are present in the [Group By clause](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/group-by-clause),
the implicit [Data Prioritization](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/data-prioritization) behaviour would be disabled.
</Note>

#### Example queries

### Introducing Timeseries Data Support to Continuous Query (June 2025)

<HorizonAIBeta />

We have expanded Continuous Query to support **timeseries resources** in addition to the previously available summary resources.

With a few simple configuration steps, Continuous Query enables you to:

1. Extract aggregations of high‑volume timeseries data collected across all your active user device connections; and

2. Offload this concern to Junction, allowing you to simplify your data pipeline and focus on extracting actionable signals.

<Accordion icon="link" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

You can now select timeseries resources in a Query:
  * For each resource, you can select all of specific fields of interest.
  * You can select multiple timeseries resources simultaneously, even though they are of different types (discrete, interval of blood pressure).

Check out the [Table Column expression](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/column-expressions) documentation.

#### Examples of Timeseries Table Column expressions

<CodeGroup>
```python Python DSL
select(
    # Blood Pressure
    Timeseries.col("blood_pressure").field("systolic"),
    Timeseries.col("blood_pressure").field("diastolic"),
    Timeseries.col("blood_pressure").field("timezone_offset"),

    # Discrete Samples
    Timeseries.col("heartrate").field("value"),
    Timeseries.col("heartrate").field("timezone_offset"),

    # Interval Samples
    Timeseries.col("body_temperature_delta").field("value"),
    Timeseries.col("body_temperature_delta").field("duration"),
    Timeseries.col("body_temperature_delta").field("sensor_location"),
    Timeseries.col("body_temperature_delta").field("timezone_offset"),

    # Workout Interval Samples
    Timeseries.col("workout_distance").field("value"),
    Timeseries.col("workout_distance").field("duration"),
    Timeseries.col("workout_distance").field("sport"),
    Timeseries.col("workout_distance").field("workout_id"),
)
```
```json JSON DSL:
[
    # Blood Pressure
    {
      "timeseries": "blood_pressure",
      "field": "systolic"
    },
    {
      "timeseries": "blood_pressure",
      "field": "diastolic"
    },
    {
      "timeseries": "blood_pressure",
      "field": "timezone_offset"
    },
    # Discrete Samples
    {
      "timeseries": "heartrate",
      "field": "value"
    },
    {
      "timeseries": "heartrate",
      "field": "timezone_offset"
    },
    {

### External User ID of User Connections (April 2025)

We now expose the _External User ID_ of User Connections in the [Provider Connection Created](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created) event
and [Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint.

The External User ID is the unique user identifier supplied by the provider, e.g., the Fitbit User ID for Fitbit connections.

Connection type               | Content
----------------------------- | ---------
OAuth Providers               | User unique identifier; provider-specific formats
Password Providers            | Username
Email Providers               | Email
Junction Mobile SDK Providers | null (not available at this time)

<Accordion icon="link" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Provider Connection Created](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created) event and
[Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### Link API Improvements (Jan 2025)

We have increased Link Token expiry from 15 minutes to 60 minutes.

We have also added an `on_error=redirect` Link Token option which forces any error scenario to redirect to your specified `redirect_url`
URL, disabling any in-built error handling behaviour in the Link Widget.

<Accordion icon="link" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Check out the [Link Error](/wearables/connecting-providers/errors) format and the [Generate a Link Token](/api-reference/link/generate-link-token) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### Extendable Historical Date Ranges (Jul 2024)
We now offer the ability to set custom historical data ranges for wearables providers, with resource-level granularity.

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
You can now extend the historical pull range for a number of supported providers using the [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences)

<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Set Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences),
[Get Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/get-team-scope-requirements), [Delete Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/delete-team-scope-requirements) endpoint documentation for more details.
</Accordion>

### Introspection: Historical Pull Timeline (May 2024)
The Historical Pull Introspection endpoint now reports the execution timeline of historical pulls.

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
The timeline tracks when the historical pull was scheduled, started, and eventually ended (success or failure). This
improves the visibility around the latency of historical pulls, as well as providing more indicator of an incomplete
execution.

Check out the [Historical Pull Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint documentation.

</Accordion>

### Team Scope Requirements (Apr 2024)
You can now tailor what scopes Vital would request from your Users using the [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/upsert-team-scope-requirements).
This applies when your user connects to an [OAuth provider](/wearables/connecting-providers/auth_types) which supports scopes.

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Vital ensures that any new provider connection can be established only when the user has granted all the scopes specified in the `user_must_grant` scope list.

The scopes specified as `user_may_grant` would be requested alongside the `user_must_grant` scopes. However, unlike `user_must_grant`, they do not prevent the connection from being established.

<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Set Team Scope Requirements](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/upsert-team-scope-requirements/upsert-team-scope-requirements) and 
[Get Team Scope Requirements](/api-reference/org-management/team-scope-requirements/get-team-scope-requirements/upsert-team-scope-requirements) endpoint documentation on how to
enable the setting.

</Accordion>

### Reject Duplicate Connections (Apr 2024)
You can now configure your Vital Team through the [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management/team/update-team)
to reject duplicate wearable connections.

<Accordion icon="person-military-pointing" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
When the `reject_duplicate_connection` setting is enabled on the Team, Vital checks whether or
not the provider-reported user ID is already connected to an existing User in your Team.

If it does, the Link API would report the [`duplicate_connection` error](/wearables/connecting-providers/errors).

<Info>
Org Management API is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

Check out the [Update Team](/api-reference/org-management/team/update-team) and 
[Create Team](/api-reference/org-management/team/create-team) endpoint documentation on how to
enable the setting.

Check out the [Link Errors](/wearables/connecting-providers/errors) documentation on how to
catch the `duplicate_connection` error.

</Accordion>


### Link Error reporting (Apr 2024)
The Link API now reports errors in terms of a predefined set of [Error Types](/wearables/connecting-providers/errors)
on which your application logic can depend.

<Accordion icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduce this because there has not been a dependable way for your application logic
to understand why a connection attempt has failed, and in turn this prevents your application
from providing actionable messages to your end users.

Depending on how you initiate the Link flow, the Link Error would be reported either as a
URL query parameter, or as part of the JSON response.

Check out the [Link Errors](/wearables/connecting-providers/errors) documentation for the detailed guidance.

</Accordion>


### Understanding Resource Availability (Apr 2024)
When a user connection to a provider is established, the webhook event now includes a resource availability
report of the connection.

<Accordion icon="signal-bars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
We introduce this because this helps you understand what resources would and would not be available on
a new connection. We also provide insights into how partial consents from users during the OAuth authentication
flow can influence the resource availability, so that you can take actions accordingly.

This resource availability report is based on the permissions *(also known as API access scopes)* the user has
granted during the authentication process.

In some cases, a provider resource may be available, but some information could be absent due to
some optional scopes having been denied by the user. The availability report includes a full breakdown
of granted and denied scopes by their optionality.

<Note>
If the provider has no concept of API access scopes, we report all resources as available.
</Note>

You can also query this information at any time through the
[Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint.

Check out the [Provider Connection Created](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created)
(`provider.connection.created`) event schema and the [Get User Connections](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint documentation.

</Accordion>


### Fallback Birth Date for Heart Rate Zones (Feb 2024)
You can now set a Fallback Birth Date on a user.

<Accordion icon="cake-candles" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
Vital can use this to compute a more accurate workout Heart Rate Zones, when the provider
exposes neither heart rate zones nor user age to Vital.

Check out the [Heart Rate Zones](/wearables/providers/heart-rate-zones#fallback-birth-date) documentation.
</Accordion>


### Grouped Timeseries (Feb 2024)
You can now get grouped timeseries data.

<Accordion icon="chart-scatter" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>

This initial release groups data by [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type)
from [supported providers](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#supported-providers).

Check out the [Blood Oxygen](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/blood-oxygen) endpoint documentation for an example.
</Accordion>


### Historical Pull Introspection (Dec 2023)
You can now introspect the status of all one-off user historical data pulls.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
It also provides the pulled date-time range, as well as a rough estimate of the amount of
data ingested (in terms of "days with data").

Check out the [Historical Pull Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>

### User Resources Introspection (Dec 2023)
You can now introspect user data ingestion statistics.

<Accordion icon="binoculars" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
For example, the endpoint provides:

1. Oldest and newest data timestamp
2. The number of objects sent in `*.created` events
3. The status and time of the last ingestion attempt (polling or push)

Check out the [User Resources Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint documentation.
</Accordion>


### Vital Sign-In Token for Mobile SDKs (Nov 2023)

Vital Sign-In Token is a new, user-scoped Authentication scheme for Vital Mobile SDKs.

<Accordion icon="id-badge" iconType="duotone" title="Details" defaultOpen>
It grants only user-scoped access to your mobile app sign-ins. This allows you to keep your Vital API Keys
as server-side secrets.

We encourage all customers using Vital API Keys in their production mobile apps to
migrate to the Vital Sign-In Token scheme.

Check out the [SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) guide on how to migrate to
this scheme. Check out the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint documentation
on how to generate tokens for your mobile app sign-ins.
</Accordion>
