Junction Link enables your users to connect their accounts with [supported cloud-based providers](/wearables/providers/introduction)
to Junction.

Junction Link is offered in two forms:

* [Junction Link Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/link_flow) is a web flow hosted by Junction, providing a complete
  provider connection wizard UX that is ready to integrate.

* [Junction Link API](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget) allows you to build your own Link Widget-like user experience.
