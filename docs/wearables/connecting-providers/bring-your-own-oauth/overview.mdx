<BYOO />

Vital supports bringing your own OAuth application credentials, so that your user would see the OAuth consent flow
in your own brand when they connect to cloud-based OAuth providers.

This provides a more cohesive experience for your users as it gives a truly whitelabelled experience for your application/mobile application.

Typically when you don't use custom credentials your oauth screen will look like this and used our shared credentials:

![Default Credentials](/img/default_credentials.png)

With custom credentials you can use your own team name and setup your own logo for the provider.

## OAuth Providers supporting BYOO

<Warning>
Some BYOO providers do not have a developer program with open sign-up.

The following providers are not immediately active. You need to take a couple of extra steps to activate them:

[Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/global/uk/home) (`fitbit`)

1. You must press the "Verify" button on all the Webhook Subscribers in the Fitbit Developer Portal.
2. Once the buttons are gone and replaced by (usually zeroed) delivery statistics, it implies that Fitbit has completed the verification challenge with Vital.

### Through Vital Support

To setup custom OAuth application credentials, you need to do the following:

1. Create a developer account with the cloud-based OAuth providers.
2. Generate a OAuth application credentials from your developer account. You can do this by going to the providers developer accounts page and creating a new application.
3. Email Support@tryvital.io or message us on Slack with the following information:
   - The provider you want to customize
   - The client ID and client secret for the provider
      - Use tools like [Doppler Secret Share](https://share.doppler.com) or [1Password](https://1password.com) to protect your credentials.
   - The redirect URI for the provider
   - The name of your team
   - The logo for your team
4. We will then setup the custom credentials for you and let you know when it's ready to go.

<Note>
Some Oauth providers are unavailable unless you can <b>Bring Your Own OAuth (BYOO)</b> — you will have to apply directly
to the provider for an OAuth application, and provide Vital your assigned credentials once the application is accepted.
