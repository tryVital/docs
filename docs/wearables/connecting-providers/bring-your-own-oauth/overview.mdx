<BYOO />

Junction supports bringing your own OAuth application credentials, so that your user would see the OAuth consent flow
in your own brand when they connect to cloud-based OAuth providers.

This provides a more cohesive experience for your users as it gives a truly whitelabelled experience for your application/mobile application.

Typically when you don't use custom credentials your oauth screen will look like this and used our shared credentials:

![Default Credentials](/img/default_credentials.png)

With custom credentials you can use your own team name and setup your own logo for the provider.

## OAuth Providers supporting BYOO

<Warning>
Some BYOO providers do not have a developer program with open sign-up.

The following providers are not immediately active. You need to take a couple of extra steps to activate them:

[Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/global/uk/home) (`fitbit`)

1. You must press the "Verify" button on all the Webhook Subscribers in the Fitbit Developer Portal.
2. Once the buttons are gone and replaced by (usually zeroed) delivery statistics, it implies that Fitbit has completed the verification challenge with Junction.

### Through the Dashboard

To setup custom OAuth application credentials via the Dashboard, you need to do the following:

1. Create a developer account with the cloud-based OAuth providers.
2. Generate a OAuth application credentials from your developer account. You can do this by going to the providers developer accounts page and creating a new application.
3. Navigate to **Custom Credentials** under **Config** on the left sidebar in the Junction Dashboard.
4. Find the provider you want to configure and click the **Setup** button.
5. In the input form that appears, enter your **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret**.

<Note>
Some OAuth providers are unavailable unless you can <b>Bring Your Own OAuth (BYOO)</b> — you will have to apply directly
to the provider for an OAuth application, and provide Junction your assigned credentials once the application is accepted.
