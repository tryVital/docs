## Error delivery

### URL Query

Vital performs a 307 Temporary Redirect to the `redirect_url` specified in your Link Token in the following scenarios:

* All connections via [the Junction Link widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/introduction)
* [Connect OAuth Provider](/api-reference/link/link-oauth-provider) endpoint used by your [Custom Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget)

Error parameters would be appended to the `redirect_url` before the redirection. For example,
given a redirect_url of `https://example.com/vital/callback`:

```
https://example.com/vital/callback
?state=error
&error_type=provider_credential_error
&error=Invalid%20username%20or%20password
```


### JSON Response

Vital responds 200 OK with a JSON response in the following scenarios:

* [Connect Password Provider](/api-reference/link/link-password-provider) endpoint used by your [Custom Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget)
* [Connect Email Provider](/api-reference/link/link-email-provider) endpoint used by your [Custom Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget)

Error parameters would be embedded into the JSON response. For example:
```json
{
  "state": "error",
  "error_type": "provider_credential_error",
  "error": "Invalid username or password"
}
```
