<BYOO />

Vital supports bringing your own OAuth application credentials, so that your user would see the OAuth consent flow
in your own brand when they connect to cloud-based OAuth providers.

This provides a more cohesive experience for your users as it gives a truly whitelabelled experience for your application/mobile application.

Typically when you don't use custom credentials your oauth screen will look like this and used our shared credentials:

![Default Credentials](/img/default_credentials.png)

With custom credentials you can use your own team name and setup your own logo for the provider.

### Through Vital Support

To setup custom OAuth application credentials, you need to do the following:

1. Create a developer account with the cloud-based OAuth providers.
2. Generate a OAuth application credentials from your developer account. You can do this by going to the providers developer accounts page and creating a new application.
3. Email Support@tryvital.io or message us on Slack with the following information:
   - The provider you want to customize
   - The client ID and client secret for the provider
   - The redirect URI for the provider
   - The name of your team
   - The logo for your team
4. We will then setup the custom credentials for you and let you know when it's ready to go.

<Note>
Some Oauth providers are unavailable unless you can <b>Bring Your Own OAuth (BYOO)</b> — you will have to apply directly
to the provider for an OAuth application, and provide Vital your assigned credentials once the application is accepted.
