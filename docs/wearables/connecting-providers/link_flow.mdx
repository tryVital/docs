The Junction Link flow starts when a user wants to connect a wearable device with Vital. An overview of the process can be found below.

<Steps>

<Step title="Pre-requisites">
Make sure that:

1. You have your Junction Team API Key [dashboard](https://app.junction.com) ready to use.

2. You have created a Vital User that corresponds to a user in your domain. [See](/home/quickstart#3-creating-your-first-user) for an example.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a Link Token">
Call the [Generate a Link Token endpoint](/api-reference/link/generate-link-token) with the target User ID using your Junction Team API Key.
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate the Link Flow">
The API response provides a short-lived Link Token (`link_token`), as well as a Web URL (`link_web_url`).

You can use the Web URL to launch the Junction Link Widget directly. Alternatively, you can use the Link Token
in concert with the Junction Link API to [build your custom Link Widget experience](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget).
</Step>
