## Auto Connect mode (default)

A connection is automatically created — or re-instated — when:

* You [ask for health data permission](/wearables/sdks/health/overview#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) through the Health SDK; or

* the Health SDK begins a data sync attempt for any resource.


<Warning>
In Auto Connect mode, any de-registration attempt through the [Deregister Connection endpoint](/api-reference/user/deregister-a-provider)
has no effect.

The Auto Connect mode will eventually re-instate the connection, typically at the next data sync attempt.
</Warning>

<Info>
Calling the Health SDK `connect()` or `disconnect()` methods in Auto Connect mode will throw an error.
</Info>

## Explicit Connect mode

<Note>
Explicit Connect mode is available on iOS SDK 1.8.0+, Android SDK 4.2.0+, React Native SDK 5.4.0+ and Flutter SDK 4.6.0+.
</Note>

A connection is created only when:

* You call the Health SDK `connect()` method.

A connection is destroyed only when:

* You call the Health SDK `disconnect()` method; or

* You use the [Deregister Connection endpoint](/api-reference/user/deregister-a-provider) to de-register the HealthKit or Health
  Connect connection remotely from your backend servers.


<Info>
`connect()` and `disconnect()` in Explicit Connect mode requires a call to Junction API over the Internet.

If the Health SDK fails to confirm connection or disconnection with the Junction API, an error would be thrown.
</Info>

In the Explicit Connect mode:

1. The Health SDK does not automatically create or re-instate a connection:

    * Not when you [ask for health data permission](/wearables/sdks/health/overview#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) through the Health SDK;

    * Not when it detects either any iOS resource which your app has asked permission for, or any Android resource which your
  app has asked permission for; and

    * Not at the beginning of any sync attempt.

2. Your application logic has full control on when to connect and disconnect.

3. You can stop data sync by de-registering HealthKit and Health Connect connection via the [Deregister Connection endpoint](/api-reference/user/deregister-a-provider).


## Pausing synchronization temporarily

The Health SDK supports a device-side [Pause Synchronization](/wearables/sdks/vital-health#pausing-data-synchronization) toggle, which
can suspend and resume data synchronization temporarily without disconnection or signing out.

This toggle works in both the Auto Connect mode and the Explicit Connect mode.
