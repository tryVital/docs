## Vital Sign-In Token

Each Vital Sign-In Token is a short-live token which authorizes a Vital Mobile SDK instance to sign in as a specific user.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Persistence" icon="hand-wave">
    The user session is persistent on the device once signed in, until you reset the SDK, your app is uninstalled, or you have deleted the user through the Vital API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Scope" icon="lock">
    Only user-level resources of the signed-in user can be accessed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>With Vital Sign-In Tokens, your Vital API Keys can be kept strictly as server-side secrets.</Warning>

### General Expectations

The Vital Mobile SDK user session lifecycle is expected to match your own user session lifecycle:

1. When your app has successfully authenticated the user with your backend service, it should begin the process to sign-in with the Vital Mobile SDK.

2. When your user has requested to sign out from your app, it should instruct the Vital Mobile SDK to reset its state.

Vital Mobile SDK maintains its signed-in user session in persistence storage.
You generally only need to request the Vital Sign-In Token once through your backend service once, and then sign-in with the Vital Mobile SDK once.

<Info>Avoid requesting a Vital Sign-In Token through your backend every time the app relaunches.</Info>

### API flow example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your app -> Your backend">
    After your app has authenticated with your backend service, your client app detects that Vital Mobile SDK is in signed-out state.
    Your app makes a `getVitalSignInToken` API call to your backend service using your own API authentication method.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend -> Vital API">
    Your backend service receives and validates the request, and forwards the request to the Vital API using a server-side secret Vital API Key.
    ```bash
    curl --request POST
      --url '{{BASE_URL}}/v2/user/{{USER_ID}}/sign_in_token'
      --header 'X-Vital-API-Key: <YOUR-API-KEY>'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vital API -> Your backend">
    Vital API creates a new Vital Sign-In Token, and returns it to your backend service. Your backend service includes the Vital Sign-In Token as part of the `getVitalSignInToken` API response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend -> Your app">
    Your app receives the API response and the Vital Sign-In Token. It then signs in with the Vital Mobile SDK using said token.

      ```swift Native iOS
      import VitalCore

      let response: MyAPIResponse

      do {
        try await VitalClient.signIn(withToken: response.signInToken)

        print("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        print("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```kotlin Native Android
      import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
      import android.content.Context
      import android.util.Log

      val response: MyAPIResponse
      val applicationContext: Context

      try {
        VitalClient.signIn(applicationContext, response.signInToken)

        Log.i("vital_sdk", "Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (e: Throwable) {
        Log.e("vital_sdk", "Error signing in with Vital", e)
      }
      ```

      ```typescript React Native
      import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

      const response: MyAPIResponse

      do {
        await VitalCore.signIn(response.signInToken)

        console.log("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        console.error("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```dart Flutter
      import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

      MyAPIResponse response;

      try {
        await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

        Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (error) {
        Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

  <Step title="Voila!">
    The Vital Mobile SDK is good to go!
  </Step>

## Vital API Keys

<Warning>
API Key is **strongly discouraged** for production mobile apps, since your API Key would be
effectively publicly distributed in cleartext. API Key support is intended only for customer
early evaluation in Sandbox.

Use [Vital Sign-In Token](#vital-sign-in-tokens) whenever possible.
</Warning>

Vital Mobile SDK can be configured to authenticate using API Key alongside a target user ID.
Please refer to the specific SDK guide:

* [iOS SDK](/wearables/sdks/ios#3-initial-setup)
* [Android SDK](/wearables/sdks/android#1-vitalclient)
* [Flutter SDK](/wearables/sdks/flutter#2-vital-core)
* [React Native SDK](/wearables/sdks/react_native#4-configure-your-dependencies)
