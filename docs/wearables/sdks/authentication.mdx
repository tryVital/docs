## Vital Sign-In Token

Each Vital Sign-In Token is a short-live token which authorizes a Vital Mobile SDK instance to sign in as a specific user.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Persistence" icon="hand-wave">
    The user session is persistent on the device once signed in, until you reset the SDK, your app is uninstalled, or you have deleted the user through the Vital API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Scope" icon="lock">
    Only user-level resources of the signed-in user can be accessed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>With Vital Sign-In Tokens, your Vital API Keys can be kept strictly as server-side secrets.</Warning>

### General Expectations

The Vital Mobile SDK user session lifecycle should match your app's user session lifecycle:

1. When your app has signed in the app user, it should sign-in with the Vital Mobile SDK.

2. When your app user is signing out from your app, it should instruct the Vital Mobile SDK to sign-out as well.

Vital Mobile SDK keeps a persistent user session on the device. This means your app only needs to sign in the user once,
by requesting a Vital Sign-In Token through your backend.

<Info>
Avoid signing in and out every time your app relaunches.
Avoid requesting Vital Sign-In Token every time your app relaunches.

### API flow example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your app -> Your backend">
    Your app starts by authenticating with your backend. There are many ways to go about this process, either your own email/password method, or some OAuth Social login (e.g. Facebook, Apple, etc). Once your backend successfully authenticates your app, you should make a second request to authenticate the app's user against Vital - this will in turn allow you to configure the SDK. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend <-> Vital API">
    Your backend service receives and validates the request. It then calls the Vital [Create Sign-In Token API](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) using your server-side Vital API Key secret.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST
      --url '{{BASE_URL}}/v2/user/{{USER_ID}}/sign_in_token'
      --header 'X-Vital-API-Key: <YOUR-API-KEY>'
    ```

    You then send the response back to your app:

    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "e209947b-323e-4108-8e18-1518b80da0bd",
      "sign_in_token": "XYZ=="
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend -> Your app">
    Your app receives the API response and Vital's `sign_in_token`. Finally, it signs in with the Vital Mobile SDK using the `signIn` method:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```swift Native iOS
      import VitalCore

      let response: MyAPIResponse = // ....

      do {
        try await VitalClient.signIn(withToken: response.signInToken)

        print("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        print("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```kotlin Native Android
      import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
      import android.content.Context
      import android.util.Log

      val response: MyAPIResponse
      val applicationContext: Context

      try {
        VitalClient.signIn(applicationContext, response.signInToken)

        Log.i("vital_sdk", "Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (e: Throwable) {
        Log.e("vital_sdk", "Error signing in with Vital", e)
      }
      ```

      ```typescript React Native
      import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

      const response: MyAPIResponse

      do {
        await VitalCore.signIn(response.signInToken)

        console.log("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        console.error("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```dart Flutter
      import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

      MyAPIResponse response;

      try {
        await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

        Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (error) {
        Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    <br />
    <Warning>
    `signIn()` throws an error when you have already signed in with the Vital SDK.

    You can [inspect the Core SDK status](/wearables/sdks/vital-core#core-sdk-status) at any time for troubleshooting. You can
    also rely on the Core SDK status to reconcile differences between your own user session state and Vital SDK sign-in.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Voila!">
    The Vital Mobile SDK is good to go!

## Vital API Keys

<Warning>
API Key is **discouraged** for production mobile apps, since it would be distributed as cleartext.
API Key support is intended only for customer early evaluation in Sandbox.

Use [Vital Sign-In Token](#vital-sign-in-tokens) whenever possible.
</Warning>

Vital Mobile SDK can be configured to authenticate using API Key alongside a target user ID.

<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  VitalClient.configure(
    apiKey: "sk_us_...",
    environment: .sandbox(.us)
  )
  VitalClient.setUserId(UUID(uuidString: "ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed")!)
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.configure(
    applicationContext,
    Region.US,
    Environment.Sandbox,
    "sk_us_..."
  )
  VitalClient.setUserId(applicationContext, "ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed")
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  await VitalCore.configure(
      "sk_us_...",
      "sandbox",
      "us",
      true,
  );
  await VitalCore.setUserId("ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed");
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  await vital_core.configure(
    "sk_us_...",
    vital_core.Environment.sandbox,
    vital_core.Region.us
  );
  await vital_core.setUserId("ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>
When running on iOS, the SDK must be **explicitly** configured before other SDK methods can be invoked.

Alternatively, follow the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit#2-integrate-with-ios-system-callbacks)
to enable SDK Automatic Configuration during app launch. This auto-configures the SDK using the last known configuration you supplied — including but
not limited to the API Key, the environment and the target User ID. Not only is this a prerequisite to enable HealthKit Background Delivery, this
allows you also to only call `configure(...)` and `setUserId(...)` once to "sign-in" the user persistently when using the Vital API Key scheme.
</Info>

## Sign Out

Regardless of the authentication scheme you used, you can sign out with the Vital SDK using `cleanUp()`.
This erases any persistent user session and configuration stored by the Vital SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  await VitalClient.shared.cleanUp()
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext).cleanUp()
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  await VitalCore.cleanUp();
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  await vital_core.cleanUp();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Migrate from Vital API Keys to Vital Sign-In Tokens

<Warning>
Always use [Vital Sign-In Token](#vital-sign-in-tokens) for your production mobile apps.
</Warning>

An existing app installation signed-in with Vital API Key + User ID can be seamlessly migrated to
use Vital Sign-In Tokens.

It is as simple as performing a one-off migration logic during app launch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Condition to migrate">
    Check whether the Vital SDK status includes `useApiKey` (i.e., the user is signed in using Vital API Key).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain a Vital Sign-In Token">
    Similar to the new user sign-in flow, your app needs to obtain a Vital Sign-In Token through your backend service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign-in with the token">
    Your app can simply sign-in with the Vital Sign-In Token.
    
    Note that it is **unnecessary to reset** the SDK beforehand — the SDK `signIn` method would automatically migrate, as
    long as the supplied Sign-In Token is compatible with the existing API Key sign-in (i.e., having the same Vital user ID,
    same Vital environment, and same Vital region).
  </Step>
</Steps>


<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  if VitalClient.status.contains(.useApiKey) {
    do {
      let response = await callBackend(...)
      try await VitalClient.signIn(withToken: response.signInToken)
    }

      print("Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch let error {
      print("Error signing in with Vital", error)
    }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context
  import android.util.Log

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext)

  if (VitalClient.Status.useApiKey in VitalClient.status) {
    try {
        val response = callBackend(...)
        VitalClient.signIn(applicationContext, response.signInToken)

        Log.i("vital_sdk", "Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        Log.e("vital_sdk", "Error signing in with Vital", e)
    }
  }
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  const status = await VitalCore.status();

  if (status.includes("useApiKey")) {
    do {
        const response = await callBackend(...);
        await VitalCore.signIn(response.signInToken);

        console.log("Signed in with Vital successfully");
    } catch let error {
        console.error("Error signing in with Vital", error);
    }
  }
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  Set<vital_core.ClientStatus> status = await vital_core.clientStatus();

  if (status.contains(vital_core.ClientStatus.useApiKey)) {
    try {
        MyAPIResponse response = await callBackend(...);
        await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

        Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch (error) {
        Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
    }
  }
  ```
