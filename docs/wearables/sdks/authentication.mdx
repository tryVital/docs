## Vital Sign-In Token

In the _Vital Sign-In Token_ scheme, each mobile app installation signs in with Vital Mobile SDK
as an individual user in your Team. The app installation would be granted only Junction API access
scoped to that specific user.

Instead of hardcoding a [Junction Team API Key](#vital-api-keys), your app would request your own backend to generate
a **Vital Sign-In Token** for the user, through your own API authentication and authorization systems.

In this model, your Junction Team API Keys are kept strictly as a server-side secret.

### Overview

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Sign in once" icon="right-to-bracket" iconType="sharp-solid" defaultOpen>

In typical circumstances, within each app installation, you would sign in your authenticated user only once
with the Vital Mobile SDK. You would do so as part of your app's user lifecycle.

There are some known circumstances where you would have to sign in the user again:

* You have signed out your user in response to your app's user lifecycle changes; or
* The Vital SDK sign-in state is out of sync with your app's user lifecycle; or
* The SDK automatically signed out, because it had detected the deletion of the Vital User.

<Note>
It is unnecessary to request and sign-in with the Vital Sign-In Token every time your app launches.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Integrating into your app's user lifecycle" icon="arrows-spin" iconType="sharp-solid" defaultOpen>

You should sign-in and sign-out of the Vital Mobile SDK as an integral part of your app's user lifecycle:

1. When the user signs in to your app, you would request the Vital Sign-In Token from your backend, and then sign in with the Vital Mobile SDK.

2. When the user signs out from your app, you would also sign out from the Vital Mobile SDK.

Vital Mobile SDK persists the signed-in Vital User — as well as any settings and sync state — across app relaunches and device reboot. 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="A recommendation to perform regular reconciliation" icon="merge" iconType="sharp-solid" defaultOpen>

We recommend regularly reconciling the state of the Vital Mobile SDK and your app's user lifecycle. This is because:

1. The SDK sign-in process involves remote API calls, which can fail due to Internet connectivity;

2. Unknown edge cases in your integration of Vital Core SDK into your app's user lifecycle may result in
   the state being out of sync; and

3. If you are integrating Vital Mobile SDK into an existing production app, this reconciliation can serve
   as a one-off migration for app installations upgrading from an older version of your app.

You can achieve this through the [Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/vital-core#core-sdk-status) API in three steps:

1. Query the [Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/vital-core#core-sdk-status) Status and the Current User ID; 
2. Compare these against your app's user state; and
3. Only if a discrepancy is detected, perform a Vital SDK sign-in or sign-out in accordance to the discrepancy.

You would typically schedule this as an asynchronous task that spawns when your application process launches.

<Warning>
Do not sign in and sign out every time your application process launches.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Technical details" icon="circle-info" iconType="sharp-solid" defaultOpen>

**Vital Sign-In Token** is a short-lived bearer token issued for a specific Vital User.
Vital Mobile SDK uses it to sign in with Vital's Identity Provider as the Vital User represented by the
token.

Each app installation can only have one active signed-in Vital User.

Internally, the Vital Mobile SDK:

1. **exchanges** the short-lived Vital Sign-In Token for a permanent sign-in, which is in the form of
  an OAuth 2.0 access token and an OAuth 2.0 refresh token.
2. discards the Vital Sign-In Token upon a successful exchange.
3. stores these token secrets securely in the device persistent storage.
4. calls the Junction API using the OAuth 2.0 access token.
5. transparently manages the OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow to keep the access token fresh and valid.

This is why the documentation emphasizes the "sign in once" expectation. The SDK does not rely on
the Vital Sign-In Token for day-to-day operation and API calls. It only needs this artifact once upfront
to exchange for the token secrets it needs.

### Case Study: A typical Backend - Mobile App flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your app -> Your identity provider">
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Your App
        actor Your Identity Provider
        autonumber
        Your App->>Your Identity Provider: User authentication
        Your Identity Provider-->>Your App: Token Secret for authenticating to your Backend API
    ```

    Your end user signs in with your Identity Provider — a separate IdP, or your own API acting as one — through password authentication,
    Social Login, Single Sign-On (SSO) or any other authentication methods.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Your app -> Your backend API">
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Your App
        actor Your Backend
        autonumber
        Your App->>Your Backend: Request the user profile
        Your Backend-->>Your App: User profile
        Your App->>Your Backend: Request a Vital Sign-In Token for the user
    ```

    Once your user has successfully authenticated, your app is issued with token secrets for accessing your backend API.
    Your app stores these token secrets securely.
    
    It then makes some API requests to your backend API, in order to gather all information required to setup your app
    into an authenticated state.

    Among these API requests, one would be requesting your backend API to issue a Vital Sign-In Token for your authenticated user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend service <-> Junction API">
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        actor Your Backend
        actor Junction API
        autonumber
        Your Backend->>Junction API: Token Request via API Key
        Junction API-->>Your Backend: Issued a Vital Sign-In Token
    ```

    Your backend API receives and validates the token issuance request. Once validated, your backend service:
    
    * Look up the Vital User associated with this authenticated user;

    * If one does not yet exist, call the [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint to create a Vital User; and

    * Call the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint to obtain a Vital Sign-In Token for
      this Vital user.

    <Note>
    Only this step would use a [Junction Team API Key](/api-details/authentication). Because this step happens in your
    backend service, this enables you to keep the Junction Team API Key strictly as a server-side secret.
    </Note>

    ```bash
    curl --request POST
      --url '{{BASE_URL}}/v2/user/{{USER_ID}}/sign_in_token'
      --header 'X-Vital-API-Key: <YOUR-API-KEY>'
    ```

    Your backend API then responds to your app with the obtained Vital Sign-In Token:

    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "e209947b-323e-4108-8e18-1518b80da0bd",
      "sign_in_token": "XYZ=="
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your backend API -> Your app">
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Your App
        participant Vital Mobile SDK
        actor Your Backend
        autonumber
        Your Backend-->>Your App: The Vital Sign-In Token
        Your App->>Vital Mobile SDK: Sign in with Vital Sign-In Token
    ```

    Your app receives a response from your backend API, which includes the Vital Sign-In Token for the authenticated
    user.
    
    Your app then calls the Vital Mobile SDK `signIn` method with the Vital Sign-In Token:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```swift Native iOS
      import VitalCore

      let response: MyAPIResponse = // ....

      do {
        try await VitalClient.signIn(withRawToken: response.signInToken)

        print("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        print("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```kotlin Native Android
      import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
      import android.content.Context
      import android.util.Log

      val response: MyAPIResponse
      val applicationContext: Context

      try {
        VitalClient.signIn(applicationContext, response.signInToken)

        Log.i("vital_sdk", "Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (e: Throwable) {
        Log.e("vital_sdk", "Error signing in with Vital", e)
      }
      ```

      ```typescript React Native
      import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

      const response: MyAPIResponse

      do {
        await VitalCore.signIn(response.signInToken)

        console.log("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch let error {
        console.error("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```

      ```dart Flutter
      import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

      MyAPIResponse response;

      try {
        await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

        Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
      } catch (error) {
        Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    <br />
    <Warning>
    `signIn()` throws an error when you have already signed in with the Vital SDK.

    You can [inspect the Core SDK status](/wearables/sdks/vital-core#core-sdk-status) at any time for troubleshooting. You can
    also rely on the Core SDK status to reconcile differences between your own user session state and Vital SDK sign-in.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Voila!">
    The Vital Mobile SDK is now signed-in with the Vital User associated with your authenticated user.
    You can now proceed to use all the Vital SDK features.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Junction Team API Keys

<Warning>
API Key is **discouraged** for production mobile apps, since it would be distributed as cleartext.
API Key support is intended only for customer early evaluation in Sandbox.

Use [Vital Sign-In Token](#vital-sign-in-token) whenever possible.
</Warning>

Vital Mobile SDK can be configured to authenticate using API Key alongside a target user ID.

<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  VitalClient.configure(
    apiKey: "sk_us_...",
    environment: .sandbox(.us)
  )
  VitalClient.setUserId(UUID(uuidString: "ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed")!)
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.configure(
    applicationContext,
    Region.US,
    Environment.Sandbox,
    "sk_us_..."
  )
  VitalClient.setUserId(applicationContext, "ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed")
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  await VitalCore.configure(
      "sk_us_...",
      "sandbox",
      "us",
      true,
  );
  await VitalCore.setUserId("ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed");
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  await vital_core.configure(
    "sk_us_...",
    vital_core.Environment.sandbox,
    vital_core.Region.us
  );
  await vital_core.setUserId("ccd6f98d-3a2a-433b-a114-8fe064f301ed");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>
When running on iOS, the SDK must be **explicitly** configured before other SDK methods can be invoked.

Alternatively, follow the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#2-integrate-with-ios-system-callbacks)
to enable SDK Automatic Configuration during app launch. This auto-configures the SDK using the last known configuration you supplied — including but
not limited to the API Key, the environment and the target User ID. Not only is this a prerequisite to enable HealthKit Background Delivery, this
allows you also to only call `configure(...)` and `setUserId(...)` once to "sign-in" the user persistently when using the Junction Team API Key scheme.
</Info>

## Sign Out

Regardless of the authentication scheme you used, you can sign out with the Vital SDK using `signOut()`.
This erases any persistent user session and configuration stored by the Vital Core and Health SDKs.

<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  await VitalClient.shared.signOut()
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext).signOut()
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  await VitalCore.signOut();
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  await vital_core.signOut();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Migrate from Junction Team API Keys to Vital Sign-In Tokens

<Warning>
Always use [Vital Sign-In Token](#vital-sign-in-tokens) for your production mobile apps.
</Warning>

An existing app installation signed-in with Junction Team API Key + User ID can be seamlessly migrated to
use Vital Sign-In Tokens.

It is as simple as performing a one-off migration logic during app launch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Condition to migrate">
    Check whether the Vital SDK status includes `useApiKey` (i.e., the user is signed in using Junction Team API Key).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain a Vital Sign-In Token">
    Similar to the new user sign-in flow, your app needs to obtain a Vital Sign-In Token through your backend service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign-in with the token">
    Your app can simply sign-in with the Vital Sign-In Token.
    
    Note that it is **unnecessary to reset** the SDK beforehand — the SDK `signIn` method would automatically migrate, as
    long as the supplied Sign-In Token is compatible with the existing API Key sign-in (i.e., having the same Vital user ID,
    same Vital environment, and same Vital region).
  </Step>
</Steps>


<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  if VitalClient.status.contains(.useApiKey) {
    do {
      let response = await callBackend(...)
      try await VitalClient.signIn(withToken: response.signInToken)
    }

      print("Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch let error {
      print("Error signing in with Vital", error)
    }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context
  import android.util.Log

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext)

  if (VitalClient.Status.useApiKey in VitalClient.status) {
    try {
        val response = callBackend(...)
        VitalClient.signIn(applicationContext, response.signInToken)

        Log.i("vital_sdk", "Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        Log.e("vital_sdk", "Error signing in with Vital", e)
    }
  }
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  const status = await VitalCore.status();

  if (status.includes("useApiKey")) {
    do {
        const response = await callBackend(...);
        await VitalCore.signIn(response.signInToken);

        console.log("Signed in with Vital successfully");
    } catch let error {
        console.error("Error signing in with Vital", error);
    }
  }
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  Set<vital_core.ClientStatus> status = await vital_core.clientStatus();

  if (status.contains(vital_core.ClientStatus.useApiKey)) {
    try {
        MyAPIResponse response = await callBackend(...);
        await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

        Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
    } catch (error) {
        Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
    }
  }
  ```
