<Note>
  We strongly recommend reading the documentation for both native iOS and
  Android. The Flutter SDK is a thin layer sitting on top of these SDKs.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Please check our [sample
  app](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-flutter/tree/main/example), that makes
  full use of the SDK.
</Tip>

## 1. Introduction

The Vital SDK is split into three main components: `vital_core`, `vital_health` and `vital_devices`.

- [vital_core](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_core) holds common
  components to both `vital_health` and `vital_devices`. Among other things, it has the network layer that allows us to
  send data from a device to a server.
- [vital_health](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_health) is an abstraction over HealthKit and Health Connect.
- [vital_devices](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_devices) is an abstraction over a set of Bluetooth devices.

## 2. Vital Core

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

## 3. Vital Health

<Tip>
  We recommend reading both the [Native iOS Guide](/wearables/sdks/ios) and the
  [Apple HealthKit Guide](/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit), since those docs
  apply to all platforms.
</Tip>

### 1. Getting Started

#### 1. Setup iOS

Please read the [iOS SDK instructions on Apple HealthKit](wearables/sdks/ios#6-vitalhealthkit). You need to edit your Capababilities and the `Info.plist` file.

#### 2. Setup Android

Please read the [Android SDK instructions on Health Connect](/wearables/sdks/android#vitalhealthconnect-installation). You need to edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` and add an xml with your requested health permssions.

#### 3. Setup Flutter

<Warning>

We strongly advise using the Vital Sign-In token approach described [here](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token).

API Key is discouraged for production mobile apps, since it would be distributed as cleartext. API Key support is intended only for customer early evaluation in Sandbox.

Use Vital Sign-In Token whenever possible.

</Warning>

Configure the SDK either by:

1. Signing in with a Vital Sign-In Token; or
2. (Non-production only) Supplying a Vital API Key **and** a target User ID.

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```dart Vital Sign-In Token
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

MyAPIResponse response;

try {
  await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

  Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
} catch (error) {
  Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
}
```
```dart Vital API Key
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

try {
  await vital_core.configure(apiKey, environment, region);
  await vital_core.setUserId(userId);

  Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
} catch (error) {
  Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
}
```
</CodeGroup>



### 2. Using the SDK

You need to ask for permissions before getting data. For example the following allows you to read and write water:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.HealthResource> readResources = [
  vital_health.HealthResource.activity,
  vital_health.HealthResource.sleep,
  vital_health.HealthResource.workout,
];
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```

And manually syncing data:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```

<Tip>
  On iOS, syncing is onfigured automatically be triggered as soon as Apple HealthKit notifies
  the Vital Mobile SDK of new data. If you have configured [iOS HealthKit Background Delivery](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit)
  as well, syncing would continue in background without any user interaction.

  On Android, syncing [needs to be manually initiated](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/android_health_connect#sync-on-app-launch). Android
  Health Connect also does not support syncing in background, since it only allows wearable data to be read whilst the app is in the foregorund (i.e.,
  actively being used by the end user).
</Tip>

You can also write data:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

Finally, you can observe the `syncStatus` stream to get updates about the Vital Health SDK synchronization state.

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```

### 3. iOS HealthKit Background Delivery

Refer to the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit) on how to enable iOS HealthKit Background Delivery.

## 4. Vital Devices

### 1. Getting Started

#### 1. iOS

Add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data between different devices</string>
```

You will have to request the bluetooth permission in your app before using the SDK.

#### 2. Android

Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

        <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
```

You will have to request the appropriate permissions at in your app before you can call the Vital Devices SDK.

### 2. Usage

First you have to scan for one of the supported devices. You can find the list of supported devices by
calling `DeviceManager().devices`.

```dart
 vitalDevices.scanForDevices(deviceModel).listen((device) {
    // now you have the device you were looking for
  });
```

Depending on the type of device you are connecting to, you will have to call different methods to connect to it.

#### 1. Blood pressure monitor

```dart
  vitalDevices.readBloodPressureData(scannedDevice).listen((bloodPressureSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of blood pressure samples
  });
```

#### 2. Glucose meter

```dart
  vitalDevices.readGlucoseMeterData(scannedDevice).listen((glucoseSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of glucose samples
  });
```

After you have received samples depending on the type of device you might need to star scanning again to receive the
next set of samples.
