<Tip>
  Please check our [sample
  app](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-flutter/tree/main/example), that makes
  full use of the SDK.
</Tip>

## 1. Introduction

The Vital SDK is split into three main components: `vital_core`, `vital_health` and `vital_devices`.

- [vital_core][1] holds common
  components to both `vital_health` and `vital_devices`. Among other things, it has the network layer that allows us to
  send data from a device to a server.
- [vital_health][2] is an abstraction over HealthKit an Health Connect(coming soon)
- [vital_devices][3] is an abstraction over a set of Bluetooth devices.

## 2. Vital Core

Initialise client with region, environment and api key

```dart
final client = VitalClient()
  ..init(region: Region.eu, environment: Environment.sandbox, apiKey: 'sk_eu_...');
```

Query users:

```dart
final Response<List<User>> usersResponse = client.userService.getAll();
```

Link data provider:

```dart
client.linkProvider(user, 'strava','vitalexample: //callback');
```

<Tip>
  Note: To return back to the app after successful linking, setup an intent
  filter in `AndroidManifest.xml` and custom URL scheme in `info.plist`. Note 2:
  Refer to
  [documentation](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/providers/Introduction) for
  all supported data providers.
</Tip>

## 3. Vital Health

#### 1. Setup ios

Please read the [iOS SDK instructions on Apple HealthKit](/wearables/sdks/ios#VitalHealthKit). You need to edit your Capababilities and the `Info.plist` file.

First create your client:

```dart
final HealthkitServices healthkitServices = HealthkitServices(
  apiKey: apiKey,
  region: region,
  environment: Environment.sandbox,
)
```

You can then configure it:

```dart
await healthkitServices.configureClient();

await healthkitServices.configureHealthkit(backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true);
```

And set the `userId`:

```dart
await client.healthkitServices.setUserId('eba7c0a2-dc01-49f5-a361-...);
```

#### 2. Using the SDK

You need to ask for permissions before getting data. For example the following allows you to read and write water:

```dart
final List<HealthkitResource> readResources = [HealthkitResource.water];
final List<HealthkitResourceWrite> writeResources = [
    HealthkitResourceWrite.water,
  ];

client.healthkitServices.ask(readResources, writeResources);
```

And syncing data:

```dart
client.healthkitServices.syncData();
```

You can also write data:

```dart
client.healthkitServices.writeHealthKitData(HealthkitResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```

Finally, observe the status stream, so you can react to changes:

```dart
Stream<SyncStatus> status = client.healthkitServices.status;
```

#### 4. Setup android

Coming soon.

## 4. Vital Devices

### 1. Getting Started

#### 1. iOS

Add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data between different devices</string>
```

You will have to request the bluetooth permission in your app before using the SDK.

#### 2. Android

Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

        <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
```

You will have to request the appropriate permissions at in your app before you can call the Vital Devices SDK.

### 2. Usage

First you have to scan for one of the supported devices. You can find the list of supported devices by
calling `DeviceManager().devices`.

```dart
 vitalDevices.scanForDevices(deviceModel).listen((device) {
    // now you have the device you were looking for
  });
```

Depending on the type of device you are connecting to, you will have to call different methods to connect to it.

#### 1. Blood pressure monitor

```dart
  vitalDevices.readBloodPressureData(scannedDevice).listen((bloodPressureSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of blood pressure samples
  });
```

#### 2. Glucose meter

```dart
  vitalDevices.readGlucoseMeterData(scannedDevice).listen((glucoseSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of glucose samples
  });
```

After you have received samples depending on the type of device you might need to star scanning again to receive the
next set of samples.

# Migrate from 0.3.* and 0.4.* to 0.5.*

Our original package **vital_flutter** is now separated into 3 packages: **vital_core**, **vital_health** and **vital_devices**.

- **vital_core** contains the Vital Client
- **vital_health** contains the Apple Health sync
- **vital_devices** contains the sdk for bluetooth devices

**vital_health** and **vital_devices** are dependent **vital_core.**

To migrate you will need to add the new plugins you need in your **pubspec.yaml** file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vital_core: ^latest_version
  vital_health: ^latest_version
  vital_devices: ^latest_version
```

All the imports have to be updated too. As an example:
`import 'package:vital_flutter/services/data/user.dart';`

needs to be changes
`import 'package:vital_core/services/data/user.dart';`

You can get all the classes by using:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart';
import 'package:vital_devices/vital_devices.dart';
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart';
```

Your IDE should offer the correct import after you have updated your **pubspec.yaml**

## Important changes:

- `DeviceManager` was moved out of the `VitalClient` to the **vital_devices** package
- `HealthkitServices` is now in the **vital_health** package
- `VitalClient` is now in **vital_core** package
