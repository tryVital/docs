<Note>
  We strongly recommend reading the documentation for both native iOS and
  Android. The Flutter SDK is a thin layer sitting on top of these SDKs.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Please check our [sample
  app](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-flutter/tree/main/example), that makes
  full use of the SDK.
</Tip>

## 1. Introduction

The Vital SDK is split into three main components: `vital_core`, `vital_health` and `vital_devices`.

- [vital_core](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_core) holds common
  components to both `vital_health` and `vital_devices`. Among other things, it has the network layer that allows us to
  send data from a device to a server.
- [vital_health](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_health) is an abstraction over HealthKit and Health Connect.
- [vital_devices](https://pub.dev/packages/vital_devices) is an abstraction over a set of Bluetooth devices.

## 2. Vital Core

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

## 3. Vital Health

<Tip>
  We recommend reading both the [Native iOS Guide](/wearables/sdks/ios) and the
  [Apple HealthKit Guide](/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit), since those docs
  apply to all platforms.
</Tip>

### 1. Getting Started

#### 1. Setup iOS

Please read the [iOS SDK instructions on Apple HealthKit](wearables/sdks/ios#6-vitalhealthkit). You need to edit your Capababilities and the `Info.plist` file.

#### 2. Setup Android

Please read the [Android SDK instructions on Health Connect](/wearables/sdks/android#vitalhealthconnect-installation). You need to edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` and add an xml with your requested health permssions.

#### 3. Setup Flutter

<Warning>

We strongly advise using the Vital Sign-In token approach described [here](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token).

API Key is discouraged for production mobile apps, since it would be distributed as cleartext. API Key support is intended only for customer early evaluation in Sandbox.

Use Vital Sign-In Token whenever possible.

</Warning>

Configure the SDK either by:

1. Signing in with a Vital Sign-In Token; or
2. (Non-production only) Supplying a Vital API Key **and** a target User ID.

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```dart Vital Sign-In Token
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

MyAPIResponse response;

try {
  await vital_core.signIn(response.signInToken)

  Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
} catch (error) {
  Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
}
```
```dart Vital API Key
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

try {
  await vital_core.configure(apiKey, environment, region);
  await vital_core.setUserId(userId);

  Fimble.i("Signed in with Vital successfully")
} catch (error) {
  Fimble.e("Error signing in with Vital", error)
}
```
</CodeGroup>



### 2. Using the SDK

You need to ask for permissions before getting data. For example the following allows you to read and write water:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.VitalResource> readResources = ;
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```

And syncing data:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```

<Tip>
  Syncing starts automatically without calling this method after the health
  client initialised and the user id is set.
</Tip>

You can also write data:

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

Finally, you can observe the `syncStatus` stream to get updates about the Vital Health SDK synchronization state.

```dart
import 'package:vital_core/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```

### 3. iOS HealthKit Background Delivery

Refer to the [Apple HealthKit guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit) on how to enable iOS HealthKit Background Delivery.

## 4. Vital Devices

### 1. Getting Started

#### 1. iOS

Add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data between different devices</string>
```

You will have to request the bluetooth permission in your app before using the SDK.

#### 2. Android

Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

        <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
```

You will have to request the appropriate permissions at in your app before you can call the Vital Devices SDK.

### 2. Usage

First you have to scan for one of the supported devices. You can find the list of supported devices by
calling `DeviceManager().devices`.

```dart
 vitalDevices.scanForDevices(deviceModel).listen((device) {
    // now you have the device you were looking for
  });
```

Depending on the type of device you are connecting to, you will have to call different methods to connect to it.

#### 1. Blood pressure monitor

```dart
  vitalDevices.readBloodPressureData(scannedDevice).listen((bloodPressureSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of blood pressure samples
  });
```

#### 2. Glucose meter

```dart
  vitalDevices.readGlucoseMeterData(scannedDevice).listen((glucoseSamples) {
    // you will receive a list of glucose samples
  });
```

After you have received samples depending on the type of device you might need to star scanning again to receive the
next set of samples.
