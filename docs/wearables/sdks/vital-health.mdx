## Initial Setup

### iOS apps: Configure your App Delegate

This section applies to:

* üîò Native iOS apps
* üîò React Native iOS apps

This section does not apply to:

* ‚ùå Fluter iOS apps (using Vital Flutter SDK 4.3.8 or later).

<Note>
Vital **Flutter** SDK (4.3.8 and later) automatically integrates with your App Delegate through the Flutter Plugin machinery.
You need not manual edit your AppDelegate in **Flutter** iOS projects.
</Note>


<Warning>
You must configure your App Delegate as instructed if you use Vital Health SDK on iOS. Not doing so
may result in missing background delivery, or app process termination by the operating system.
</Warning>

In your AppDelegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` implementation, it **must** call Vital Health SDK
`automaticConfiguration()` synchronously before it returns.


<Accordion title="Details" icon="apple" defaultOpen>

Vital needs to register various handlers with the system frameworks like Apple HealthKit and BackgroundTasks. These frameworks
require said registrations to be completed **before** the "app finished launching" moment [[1]](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614175-enablebackgrounddelivery#3801028)
[[2]](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler/register(fortaskwithidentifier:using:launchhandler:)#Discussion).

For React Native apps, the AppDelegate is part of the template Swift or Objective-C code in your generated Xcode project.

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
import VitalHealthKit

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil
  ) -> Bool {

    VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()

    // ...

    return true
  }
}
```

```swift Objective-C / React Native
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "VitalHealthKitConfiguration.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  [VitalHealthKitConfiguration automaticConfiguration];

  // ...

  return YES;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

### Configure the Vital Health SDK

The Health SDK must be configured before use. The configuration is persistent, so
you can do this only once, immediately after [a successful authentication with the Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/authentication).


<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.configure(
  backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.configure(context)
manager.configureHealthConnectClient(
  syncNotificationBuilder = null
)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, HealthConfig } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

let config = new HealthConfig();
config.iOSConfig.backgroundDeliveryEnabled = true;
await VitalHealth.configure(config);
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.configure(
  config: const vital_health.HealthConfig(
    iosConfig: vital_health.IosHealthConfig(
      backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Health Data Permissions

### Ask user for health data permissions

Before the SDK can read any data, you need to ask the end user to grant health data permissions.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.ask(
  readPermissions: [.activity, .workout, .sleep],
  writePermissions: []
)
```

```kotlin Native Android

//
// Android Compose
//

import androidx.activity.compose.rememberLauncherForActivityResult
import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberCoroutineScope
import androidx.compose.material3.*
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...
val contract = manager.createPermissionRequestContract(
  readResources = set(
    VitalResource.Activity,
    VitalResource.Workout,
    VitalResource.Sleep,
  ),
  writeResources = emptySet(),
)

val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val permissionsLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  coroutineScope.launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}

Button(onClick = { permissionsLauncher.launch(Unit) }) {
  Text("Ask for permission")
}

//
// AndroidX Activity Result API
//
import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val activity: ComponentActivity = ...
val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...

activity.registerForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.ask(
    [VitalResource.Activity, VitalResource.Workout, VitalResource.Sleep],
    []
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.HealthResource> readResources = [
  vital_health.HealthResource.activity,
  vital_health.HealthResource.sleep,
  vital_health.HealthResource.workout,
];
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```
</CodeGroup>

Regardless of whether the user has granted or denied the permissions, any subsequent re-request would
be non-interactive and returns instantly. This is because the operating system only prompts the end user
once for each resource type.

If you wish
to provide a way for users to review their permission grants or denials, you can
[inform them of the system app location where they can do so](#check-if-a-read-permission-was-granted-or-denied-spoiler-you-cant).

<Warning>
The health data read permission prompted is managed by the operating system. Vital cannot customize or
alter its behaviour.
</Warning>

### Check if your app has asked for permissions before

You can check if your app has already asked the user _at least once_ before, for permissions on a specific `VitalResource`.

Because [Ask for Permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) are gracefully ignored by the operating system beyond
the first time, checking before asking can help you skip the parts of your UX journey that only makes sense to users
going through [Ask for Permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) for the first time.

The only exception to this behaviour is when a `VitalResource` pulls a new data type introduced in a new OS release.
In this scenario, calling [Ask for Permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) would result in a OS permission
prompt that asks for permissions on _specifically_ those new data types.

If you wish
to provide a way for users to review their permission grants or denials, you can
[inform them of the system app location where they can do so](#check-if-a-read-permission-was-granted-or-denied-spoiler-you-cant).


<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.hasAskedForPermission(resource: .activity)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.configure(context)
manager.hasAskedForPermission(VitalResource.Activity)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.hasAskedForPermission(VitalResource.Activity);
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.hasAskedForPermission(vital_health.HealthResource.Activity);
```
</CodeGroup>


### Check if a read permission was granted or denied (‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler: You can't)

Vital Health SDK allows you to [ask for permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) and
[check if your app has asked for permission before](#check-if-your-app-has-asked-for-permissions-before).

However, Vital Health SDK **cannot** tell you:

1. Whether or not a user has granted or denied a read permission after the [Ask for Permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) has concluded.
1. The state of a read permission at any exact moment ‚Äî granted or denied.

Apple made a deliberate choice to conceal the state of HealthKit data type read permissions from third-party apps.
Quoting [Apple's own words](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614154-authorizationstatus) (as at 27 September 2024):

> To help prevent possible leaks of sensitive health information, your app cannot determine whether or not a user has granted permission to read data.
>
> If you are not given permission, it simply appears as if there is no data of the requested type in the HealthKit store.
>
> [...]

In other words, all third-party apps ‚Äî including anyone using the Vital Health SDK ‚Äî would:

1. not be able to determine if a particular read permission has been granted or denied by the user;

2. not be able to manage or review read permissions inside their app.

The best course of action out of this is to inform your users of the location where they can review and manage their health data read permissions:

| Operating System     | System App         | Location |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| iOS 8.0 and above    | Health app         | Sharing > Apps and Services |
| iOS 15.0 and above   | Settings app       | Privacy & Security > Health |
| Android 13 or below  | Health Connect app | Apps and Permissions |
| Android 14 and above | Settings app       | Health Connect > Apps and Permissions |

<Note>

When designing your user experience, **assume** you would have zero knowledge of
permission grants and denials after the user has gone through the [Ask for Permission](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions) flow.

</Note>

## Automatic Data Sync

Vital Health SDK automates data sync for you on both Android and iOS. Please first consult
the provider-specific guides for the requirements and setup instructions:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect)


### iOS

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two behaviours: <ul><li>Foreground: Apple HealthKit immediately delivers buffered and new changes.</li><li>Background: Hourly batch delivery of changes, subject to OS throttling.</li></ul> |

<Note>
HealthKit change notification is an always-on behaviour.

If you did not configure [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
as instructed, your app will not receive any HealthKit change notification while it is in background.
In turn, background sync would not occur.
</Note>

### Android

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two mechanisms: <ul><li>[Sync On App Launch](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-on-app-launch)</li><li>[Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) if it is enabled.</li></ul> |

<Note>
Sync On App Launch is an always-on behaviour. Background Sync (Experimental) is an **opt-in** behaviour.

Please refer to the [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect) for the full context
and required configuration of these two behaviours.
</Note>

### Background Sync Frequency

Vital Health SDK schedules hourly background sync with both Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect, provided that you have:

1. Configured [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit) as per instruction; and
2. Configured [Health Connect Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) and request user permissions (when necessary) as per instruction.

However, this schedule is only advisory. The OS has full discretion to defer the scheduled time based on runtime
constraints like battery power, as well as platform background execution policies. For more detailed explanation, please refer to:

* [Apple HealthKit: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#sync-frequency)
* [Android Health Connect: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-frequency)

In other words, your product experience should not assume near real-time availability of wearable data, since the norm
is a variable delay ranging from an hour to a day. Longer delay is also possible due to the lack of Internet
connectivity, e.g.,  a long-haul flight, or an off-the-grid trip.

The only possible exception is when your product experience does involve
**active usage** of your consumer app with an active Internet connection. For example, iOS 17+ supports third-party
apps initiating an Apple Watch workout session that would be live synced with your iPhone app.


### Pausing Data Synchronization

You can pause and unpause data sync at any time, without having to sign-out the user from the Vital Mobile SDK.
Note that pausing data sync does not reset the incremental sync progress and does not trigger a historical stage
upon unpause. It only "freezes" the sync progress.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

// Pause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
print("Paused? \(VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization)")
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

// Pause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
Log.i("sync", "Paused? ${manager.pauseSynchronization}")
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

// Pause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(true);

// Unpause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(false);

// Check if synchronization is paused
const isPaused = await VitalHealth.pauseSynchronization;
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

// Pause Synchronization
await vital_health.setPauseSynchronization(true);

// Unpause Synchronization
await vital_health.setPauseSynchronization(false);

// Check if synchronization is paused
final isPaused = await vital_health.pauseSynchronization;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Manually start data sync

You can force data sync to start with `syncData()`.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.syncData()
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.syncData()
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.syncData();
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Writing data

You can also write data back to Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

try await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.write(
  input: .water(milliliters: 1000),
  startDate: Date(),
  endDate: Date()
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.model.WritableVitalResource

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.writeRecord(
    WritableVitalResource.Water,
    Instant.now(),
    Instant.now(),
    100.0
)
```

```typescript React Native
await VitalHealth.writeHealthData(
    VitalWriteResource.Water,
    100.0,
    new Date(),
    new Date(),
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

## Sync Status

You can observe the `syncStatus` stream for continuous updates on the health data sync status.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.status.sink { status in
  print("Sync Status: \(status)")
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*

val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope
val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.status
  .onEach { status -> Log.i("HealthDataSync", "$status") }
  .launchIn(coroutineScope)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealthEvents, VitalHealthReactNativeModule } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

const healthEventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(VitalHealthReactNativeModule);

healthEventEmitter.addListener(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, (event: any) => {
  console.log(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, event);
});
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```
</CodeGroup>


## Sync Progress Debugging UI (iOS only)

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Sync Progress View on Native iOS" defaultOpen>
Vital Health SDK for iOS includes a `ForEachVitalResource` ‚Äî a pre-baked SwiftUI View providing a
live-updated sync progress feed of all the `VitalResource`s whose permissions have been asked for.

You can use `ForEachVitalResource()` in any position which you would use `ForEach`. For example,
you can use it inside a `Section` of a `List`:

```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

struct SyncProgressView: View {
  var view: some View {
    List {
      Section(header: Text("Sync Progress")) {
        ForEachVitalResource()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using UIKit, you can still access it through `UIHostingController`:

```swift Native iOS
let viewController: UIViewController

let hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: SyncProgressView())
viewController.present(hostingController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sync Progress UI on Flutter / React Native" defaultOpen>
You can open the Apple HealthKit Sync Progress Inspector UI through a simple call:

<CodeGroup>
```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

unawaited(vital_health.openSyncProgressView());
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.openSyncProgressView();
```
</CodeGroup>

This Sync Progress Inspector UI provides a live-updated sync progress feed of all the VitalResources whose permissions have been asked for.

<Note>
Note that it is currently a no-op on Android.
