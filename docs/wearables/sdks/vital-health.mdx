title: "Health SDK"

## Overview

Please consult the following guides on requirements and restrictions of Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android_health_connect)

The Health SDK guide focuses on the API usage of the Health SDK.

## SDK configuration

The Health SDK must be configured before use. The configuration is persistent, so
you can do this only once, immediately after [a successful authentication with the Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/authentication).


<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.configure(
  backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.configure(context)
manager.configureHealthConnectClient(
  syncNotificationBuilder = null
)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, HealthConfig } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

let config = new HealthConfig();
config.iOSConfig.backgroundDeliveryEnabled = true;
await VitalHealth.configure(config);
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.configure(
  config: const vital_health.HealthConfig(
    iosConfig: vital_health.IosHealthConfig(
      backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```
</CodeGroup>


## Request health data permissions

Before the SDK can read any data, you need to ask the end user to grant health data permissions.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.ask(
  readPermissions: [.activity, .workout, .sleep],
  writePermissions: []
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
val contract = vitalHealthConnectManager.createPermissionRequestContract(
  readResources = set(
    VitalResource.Activity,
    VitalResource.Workout,
    VitalResource.Sleep,
  ),
  writeResources = emptySet(),
)

//
// Launch via Compose UI
//
import androidx.activity.compose.rememberLauncherForActivityResult
import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberCoroutineScope
import androidx.compose.material3.*

val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val permissionsLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  coroutineScope.launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}

Button(onClick = { permissionsLauncher.launch(Unit) }) {
  Text("Request")
}

//
// Launch via AndroidX Activity Result API
//
import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity

val activity: ComponentActivity
activity.registerForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.ask(
    [VitalResource.Activity, VitalResource.Workout, VitalResource.Sleep],
    []
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.HealthResource> readResources = [
  vital_health.HealthResource.activity,
  vital_health.HealthResource.sleep,
  vital_health.HealthResource.workout,
];
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the OS only prompts the end user once for each resource type. Subsequent requests are
gracefully ignored by the OS.

## Manually start data sync

You can force data sync to start with `syncData()`.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.syncData()
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.syncData()
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.syncData();
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Automatic Data Sync
### iOS
On iOS, syncing is triggered automatically as soon as Apple HealthKit notifies the Vital Mobile SDK of new data.
If you have configured [iOS HealthKit Background Delivery](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit)
as well, syncing would continue in background without any user interaction.

### Android
On Android, syncing [needs to be manually initiated](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/guides/android_health_connect#sync-on-app-launch). Android
Health Connect also does not support syncing in background, since it only allows wearable data to be read whilst the app is in the foregorund (i.e.,
actively being used by the end user).


## Writing data

You can also write data back to Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

try await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.write(
  input: .water(milliliters: 1000),
  startDate: Date(),
  endDate: Date()
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.model.WritableVitalResource

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.writeRecord(
    WritableVitalResource.Water,
    Instant.now(),
    Instant.now(),
    100.0
)
```

```typescript React Native
await VitalHealth.writeHealthData(
    VitalWriteResource.Water,
    100.0,
    new Date(),
    new Date(),
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

## Sync Status

You can observe the `syncStatus` stream for continuous updates on the health data sync status.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.status.sink { status in
  print("Sync Status: \(status)")
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*

val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope
val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.status
  .onEach { status -> Log.i("HealthDataSync", "$status") }
  .launchIn(coroutineScope)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealthEvents, VitalHealthReactNativeModule } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

const healthEventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(VitalHealthReactNativeModule);

healthEventEmitter.addListener(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, (event: any) => {
  console.log(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, event);
});
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```
</CodeGroup>
