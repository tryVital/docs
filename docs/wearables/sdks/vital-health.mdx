## Overview

Please consult the following guides on requirements and restrictions of Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect)

The Health SDK guide focuses on the API usage of the Health SDK.

## SDK configuration

The Health SDK must be configured before use. The configuration is persistent, so
you can do this only once, immediately after [a successful authentication with the Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/authentication).


<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.configure(
  backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.configure(context)
manager.configureHealthConnectClient(
  syncNotificationBuilder = null
)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, HealthConfig } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

let config = new HealthConfig();
config.iOSConfig.backgroundDeliveryEnabled = true;
await VitalHealth.configure(config);
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.configure(
  config: const vital_health.HealthConfig(
    iosConfig: vital_health.IosHealthConfig(
      backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```
</CodeGroup>


## Ask user for health data permissions

Before the SDK can read any data, you need to ask the end user to grant health data permissions.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Native iOS">
```swift
import VitalHealthKit

await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.ask(
  readPermissions: [.activity, .workout, .sleep],
  writePermissions: []
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Native Android">
<CodeGroup>
```kotlin Android Compose
import androidx.activity.compose.rememberLauncherForActivityResult
import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberCoroutineScope
import androidx.compose.material3.*
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...
val contract = manager.createPermissionRequestContract(
  readResources = set(
    VitalResource.Activity,
    VitalResource.Workout,
    VitalResource.Sleep,
  ),
  writeResources = emptySet(),
)

val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val permissionsLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  coroutineScope.launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}

Button(onClick = { permissionsLauncher.launch(Unit) }) {
  Text("Ask for permission")
}
```

```kotlin AndroidX Activity Result API
import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val activity: ComponentActivity = ...
val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...

activity.registerForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>

<Tab title="React Native">
```typescript
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.ask(
    [VitalResource.Activity, VitalResource.Workout, VitalResource.Sleep],
    []
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Flutter">
```dart
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.HealthResource> readResources = [
  vital_health.HealthResource.activity,
  vital_health.HealthResource.sleep,
  vital_health.HealthResource.workout,
];
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Note that the OS only prompts the end user once for each resource type. Subsequent requests are
gracefully ignored by the OS.


## Automatic Data Sync

Vital Health SDK automates data sync for you on both Android and iOS. Please first consult
the provider-specific guides for the requirements and setup instructions:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect)


### iOS

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two behaviours: <ul><li>Foreground: Apple HealthKit immediately delivers buffered and new changes.</li><li>Background: Hourly batch delivery of changes, subject to OS throttling.</li></ul> |

<Note>
HealthKit change notification is an always-on behaviour.

If you did not configure [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
as instructed, your app will not receive any HealthKit change notification while it is in background.
In turn, background sync would not occur.
</Note>

### Android

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two mechanisms: <ul><li>[Sync On App Launch](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-on-app-launch)</li><li>[Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) if it is enabled.</li></ul> |

<Note>
Sync On App Launch is an always-on behaviour. Background Sync (Experimental) is an **opt-in** behaviour.

Please refer to the [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect) for the full context
and required configuration of these two behaviours.
</Note>

### Background Sync Frequency

Vital Health SDK schedules hourly background sync with both Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect, provided that you have:

1. Configured [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit) as per instruction; and
2. Configured [Health Connect Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) and request user permissions (when necessary) as per instruction.

However, this schedule is only advisory. The OS has full discretion to defer the scheduled time based on runtime
constraints like battery power, as well as platform background execution policies. For more detailed explanation, please refer to:

* [Apple HealthKit: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#sync-frequency)
* [Android Health Connect: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-frequency)

In other words, your product experience should not assume near real-time availability of wearable data, since the norm
is a variable delay ranging from an hour to a day. Longer delay is also possible due to the lack of Internet
connectivity, e.g.,  a long-haul flight, or an off-the-grid trip.

The only possible exception is when your product experience does involve
**active usage** of your consumer app with an active Internet connection. For example, iOS 17+ supports third-party
apps initiating an Apple Watch workout session that would be live synced with your iPhone app.


### Pausing Data Synchronization

You can pause and unpause data sync at any time, without having to sign-out the user from the Vital Mobile SDK.
Note that pausing data sync does not reset the incremental sync progress and does not trigger a historical stage
upon unpause. It only "freezes" the sync progress.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

// Pause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
print("Paused? \(VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization)")
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

// Pause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
Log.i("sync", "Paused? ${manager.pauseSynchronization}")
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

// Pause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(true);

// Unpause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(false);

// Check if synchronization is paused
const isPaused = await VitalHealth.pauseSynchronization;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Manually start data sync

You can force data sync to start with `syncData()`.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.syncData()
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.syncData()
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.syncData();
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Writing data

You can also write data back to Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

try await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.write(
  input: .water(milliliters: 1000),
  startDate: Date(),
  endDate: Date()
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.model.WritableVitalResource

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.writeRecord(
    WritableVitalResource.Water,
    Instant.now(),
    Instant.now(),
    100.0
)
```

```typescript React Native
await VitalHealth.writeHealthData(
    VitalWriteResource.Water,
    100.0,
    new Date(),
    new Date(),
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

## Sync Status

You can observe the `syncStatus` stream for continuous updates on the health data sync status.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.status.sink { status in
  print("Sync Status: \(status)")
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*

val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope
val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.status
  .onEach { status -> Log.i("HealthDataSync", "$status") }
  .launchIn(coroutineScope)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealthEvents, VitalHealthReactNativeModule } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

const healthEventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(VitalHealthReactNativeModule);

healthEventEmitter.addListener(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, (event: any) => {
  console.log(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, event);
});
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```
</CodeGroup>
