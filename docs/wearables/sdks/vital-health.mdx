## Overview

Please consult the following guides on requirements and restrictions of Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect)

The Health SDK guide focuses on the API usage of the Health SDK.

## Configure your App Delegate (iOS only)

<Note>This applies to all iOS integrations â€” Native iOS, React Native or Flutter.</Note>

Your AppDelegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` implementation must call `VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()` 
before it returns.


<Accordion title="Details" icon="apple">

Vital needs to register various handlers with the system frameworks like Apple HealthKit and BackgroundTasks. These frameworks
require said registrations to be completed **before** the "app finished launching" moment [[1]](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614175-enablebackgrounddelivery#3801028)
[[2]](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler/register(fortaskwithidentifier:using:launchhandler:)#Discussion).

If this requirement is not satisfied, background delivery may be missed, and the app process may be terminated.

For React Native and Flutter apps, the AppDelegate is part of the template Swift or Objective-C code in your generated Xcode project.

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift / Flutter
import VitalHealthKit

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil
  ) -> Bool {

    VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()

    // ...

    return true
  }
}
```

```swift Objective-C / React Native
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "VitalHealthKitConfiguration.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  [VitalHealthKitConfiguration automaticConfiguration];

  // ...

  return YES;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

## SDK configuration

The Health SDK must be configured before use. The configuration is persistent, so
you can do this only once, immediately after [a successful authentication with the Core SDK](/wearables/sdks/authentication).


<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.configure(
  backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.configure(context)
manager.configureHealthConnectClient(
  syncNotificationBuilder = null
)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, HealthConfig } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

let config = new HealthConfig();
config.iOSConfig.backgroundDeliveryEnabled = true;
await VitalHealth.configure(config);
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.configure(
  config: const vital_health.HealthConfig(
    iosConfig: vital_health.IosHealthConfig(
      backgroundDeliveryEnabled: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```
</CodeGroup>


## Ask user for health data permissions

Before the SDK can read any data, you need to ask the end user to grant health data permissions.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.ask(
  readPermissions: [.activity, .workout, .sleep],
  writePermissions: []
)
```

```kotlin Native Android

//
// Android Compose
//

import androidx.activity.compose.rememberLauncherForActivityResult
import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberCoroutineScope
import androidx.compose.material3.*
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...
val contract = manager.createPermissionRequestContract(
  readResources = set(
    VitalResource.Activity,
    VitalResource.Workout,
    VitalResource.Sleep,
  ),
  writeResources = emptySet(),
)

val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val permissionsLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  coroutineScope.launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}

Button(onClick = { permissionsLauncher.launch(Unit) }) {
  Text("Ask for permission")
}

//
// AndroidX Activity Result API
//
import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val activity: ComponentActivity = ...
val manager: VitalHealthConnectManager = ...

activity.registerForActivityResult(contract) { outcomeAsync ->
  CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val outcome = outcomeAsync.await()
    Log.i("VitalPermissionOutcome", outcome.toString())
  }
}
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.ask(
    [VitalResource.Activity, VitalResource.Workout, VitalResource.Sleep],
    []
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

final List<vital_health.HealthResource> readResources = [
  vital_health.HealthResource.activity,
  vital_health.HealthResource.sleep,
  vital_health.HealthResource.workout,
];
await vital_health.askForPermission(readResources, []);
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the operating system only prompts the end user once for each resource type. Subsequent requests are
gracefully ignored by the OS.

<Warning>
The health data read permission prompted is managed by the operating system. Vital cannot customize or
alter its behaviour.
</Warning>

## Automatic Data Sync

Vital Health SDK automates data sync for you on both Android and iOS. Please first consult
the provider-specific guides for the requirements and setup instructions:

* [Apple HealthKit guide](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
* [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect)


### iOS

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two behaviours: <ul><li>Foreground: Apple HealthKit immediately delivers buffered and new changes.</li><li>Background: Hourly batch delivery of changes, subject to OS throttling.</li></ul> |

<Note>
HealthKit change notification is an always-on behaviour.

If you did not configure [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit)
as instructed, your app will not receive any HealthKit change notification while it is in background.
In turn, background sync would not occur.
</Note>

### Android

| Sync is automatically... |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Activated on             | All resource types you have [asked permission for](#ask-user-for-health-data-permissions). |
| Triggered by             | Two mechanisms: <ul><li>[Sync On App Launch](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-on-app-launch)</li><li>[Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) if it is enabled.</li></ul> |

<Note>
Sync On App Launch is an always-on behaviour. Background Sync (Experimental) is an **opt-in** behaviour.

Please refer to the [Android Health Connect guide](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect) for the full context
and required configuration of these two behaviours.
</Note>

### Background Sync Frequency

Vital Health SDK schedules hourly background sync with both Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect, provided that you have:

1. Configured [Apple HealthKit Background Delivery](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit) as per instruction; and
2. Configured [Health Connect Background Sync (Experimental)](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#background-sync-experimental) and request user permissions (when necessary) as per instruction.

However, this schedule is only advisory. The OS has full discretion to defer the scheduled time based on runtime
constraints like battery power, as well as platform background execution policies. For more detailed explanation, please refer to:

* [Apple HealthKit: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/apple-healthkit#sync-frequency)
* [Android Health Connect: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-frequency)

In other words, your product experience should not assume near real-time availability of wearable data, since the norm
is a variable delay ranging from an hour to a day. Longer delay is also possible due to the lack of Internet
connectivity, e.g.,  a long-haul flight, or an off-the-grid trip.

The only possible exception is when your product experience does involve
**active usage** of your consumer app with an active Internet connection. For example, iOS 17+ supports third-party
apps initiating an Apple Watch workout session that would be live synced with your iPhone app.


### Pausing Data Synchronization

You can pause and unpause data sync at any time, without having to sign-out the user from the Vital Mobile SDK.
Note that pausing data sync does not reset the incremental sync progress and does not trigger a historical stage
upon unpause. It only "freezes" the sync progress.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

// Pause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
print("Paused? \(VitalHealthKitClient.shared.pauseSynchronization)")
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

// Pause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = true

// Unpause Synchronization
manager.pauseSynchronization = false

// Check if synchronization is paused
Log.i("sync", "Paused? ${manager.pauseSynchronization}")
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

// Pause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(true);

// Unpause Synchronization
await VitalHealth.setPauseSynchronization(false);

// Check if synchronization is paused
const isPaused = await VitalHealth.pauseSynchronization;
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

// Pause Synchronization
await vital_health.setPauseSynchronization(true);

// Unpause Synchronization
await vital_health.setPauseSynchronization(false);

// Check if synchronization is paused
final isPaused = await vital_health.pauseSynchronization;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Manually start data sync

You can force data sync to start with `syncData()`.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.syncData()
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.syncData()
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealth } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

await VitalHealth.syncData();
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.syncData();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Writing data

You can also write data back to Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

try await VitalHealthKitClient.shared.write(
  input: .water(milliliters: 1000),
  startDate: Date(),
  endDate: Date()
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.model.WritableVitalResource

val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.writeRecord(
    WritableVitalResource.Water,
    Instant.now(),
    Instant.now(),
    100.0
)
```

```typescript React Native
await VitalHealth.writeHealthData(
    VitalWriteResource.Water,
    100.0,
    new Date(),
    new Date(),
)
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

await vital_health.writeHealthData(vital_health.HealthResourceWrite.water, startDate, endDate, 1000);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Not all resources are writable in both iOS and Android. Please refer to the
  `health_resource.dart` file.
</Tip>

## Sync Status

You can observe the `syncStatus` stream for continuous updates on the health data sync status.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

VitalHealthKitClient.shared.status.sink { status in
  print("Sync Status: \(status)")
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthConnectManager
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*

val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope
val manager = VitalHealthConnectManager.getOrCreate(context)

manager.status
  .onEach { status -> Log.i("HealthDataSync", "$status") }
  .launchIn(coroutineScope)
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalHealthEvents, VitalHealthReactNativeModule } from "@tryvital/vital-health-react-native";

const healthEventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(VitalHealthReactNativeModule);

healthEventEmitter.addListener(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, (event: any) => {
  console.log(VitalHealthEvents.statusEvent, event);
});
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_health/vital_health.dart' as vital_health;

Stream<SyncStatus> status = vital_health.syncStatus;
```
</CodeGroup>


## Sync Progress Debugging UI (iOS only)

Vital Health SDK for iOS includes a `ForEachVitalResource` â€” a pre-baked SwiftUI View providing a
live-updated sync progress feed of all the `VitalResource`s whose permissions have been asked for.

You can use `ForEachVitalResource()` in any position which you would use `ForEach`. For example,
you can use it inside a `Section` of a `List`:

```swift Native iOS
import VitalHealthKit

struct SyncProgressView: View {
  var view: some View {
    List {
      Section(header: Text("Sync Progress")) {
        ForEachVitalResource()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using UIKit, you can still access it through `UIHostingController`:

```swift Native iOS
let viewController: UIViewController

let hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: SyncProgressView())
viewController.present(hostingController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
