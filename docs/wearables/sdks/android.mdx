    Please check our [sample
    app](https://github.com/tryVital/vital-android/tree/main/app), that makes
    full use of the SDK.
</Tip>

## 1. Introduction

The Vital SDK is split into three main components: `VitalClient`, `VitalHealthConnect`
and `VitalDevices`.

- `VitalClient` holds common components to both `VitalHealthConnect` and `VitalDevices`. Among other
things, it has the network layer that allows us to send data from a device to a server.
- `VitalHealthConnect` is an abstraction over Health Connect
- `VitalDevices` is an abstraction over a set of Bluetooth devices.

## 2. Installation

You can install the Vital SDK by adding the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.tryVital.vital-android:VitalClient:$vital_version'
implementation 'com.github.tryVital.vital-android:VitalHealthConnect:$vital_version'
implementation 'com.github.tryVital.vital-android:VitalDevices:$vital_version'
```

Replace `$vital_version` with the latest version of the SDK. You only need to add the dependencies
for the components you want to use.

The min version of the SDK is `21` for VitalClient but for VitalHealthConnect and VitalDevices it is
`26`.

### VitalHealthClient installation

You have no additional steps to take to use VitalHealthClient.

### VitalHealthConnect installation

The sdk compiles on min version `26` but to get data out of the underlying Health Connect SDK you
need to be on `28` or higher.

### VitalDevices installation

Vital Devices uses bluetooth, and it requires different permissions based on you apps min version.
Here is an example of a `AndroidManifest.xml` file that uses Vital Devices:

```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

    <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
```

## 3. Usage

### 1. VitalClient

First you need to get an instance of `VitalClient`:

```kotlin
    val client = VitalClient(
    context = this,
    region = Region.EU,
    environment = Environment.Sandbox,
    apiKey = "sk_eu_S5L..." //your key from the dashboard
)
```

Now you can start using the client to send and receive data from the server.

You can read about the available methods in
the [docs](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/user/create-user).

### 2.  VitalHealthConnect

Health Connect is the new unified health data platform from Google. You can read more about it here - https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect
Vital Health Connect is an abstraction over Health Connect that allows you to easily and automatically get data from Health Connect and upload it to Vital.

To interact with Vital Health Connect you need an instance of `VitalHealthConnectManager`:
```kotlin
val vitalHealthConnectManager = VitalHealthConnectManager.create(context, apiKey, region, environment);
```

You should first check if Health Connect is available on the device:
```kotlin
vitalHealthConnectManager.isAvailable(context)
```

After you have a user id you need to set it on the manager:
```kotlin
vitalHealthConnectManager.setUserId(userId)
```

If this user is not yet linked to Health Connect provider you need to link it:
```kotlin
vitalHealthConnectManager.linkUserHealthConnectProvider("callbackUrl")
```

Now you can start syncing data:
```kotlin
vitalHealthConnectManager.configureHealthConnectClient(
    logsEnabled = false,
    syncOnAppStart = true, //this requires further setup
    numberOfDaysToBackFill = 30,
)
```

The call to `configureHealthConnectClient` will start syncing data immediately from Health Connect.
You only need to call configure once. If you want to change the configuration you can call it again.

<Warning>
    We can only sync health data which we have permission granted by the user.
    You need to request these permissions. You can see all the used permission in the
    `VitalHealthConnectManager.vitalRequiredPermissions`
    property.
    You can check what permissions are granted by the user by calling
    `VitalHealthConnectManager.getGrantedPermissions(context)`.
</Warning>

If you know that you have new data in Health Connect you can force a sync:
```kotlin
vitalHealthConnectManager.syncData()
```

You can configure the sync to happen on app start. To do this you need to add the following to your manifest:
```xml
    <provider
        android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
        android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
        android:exported="false"
        tools:node="merge">
        <meta-data  android:name="io.tryvital.vitalhealthconnect.VitalHealthInitializer"
            android:value="androidx.startup" />
    </provider>
```

### 3. VitalDevices

To interact with Vital Devices sdk you need to get an instance of the `VitalDeviceManager`:

```kotlin
val deviceManager = VitalDeviceManager.create(context)
```

Next you have to scan for one of the supported devices. You can find the list of supported devices
by calling `VitalDeviceManagerBrands.devices`.

You can search now.

```kotlin
vitalDeviceManager.search(deviceModel).collect { scannedDevice ->
    // scannedDevice is the device that was found of the type deviceModel
}
```

Depending on the type of device you are connecting to, you will have to call different methods to
connect to it.

#### 1. Blood pressure monitor

```kotlin
vitalDeviceManager.bloodPressure(context, scannedDevice)
    .collect { bloodPressureSample ->
        // bloodPressureSample is the sample that was received from the device
    }
```

#### 2. Glucose meter

```kotlin
vitalDeviceManager.glucoseMeter(context, scannedDevice)
    .collect { glucoseSample ->
        // glucoseSample is the sample that was received from the device
    }
```

After you have received samples depending on the type of device you might need to star scanning
again to receive the next set of samples.
