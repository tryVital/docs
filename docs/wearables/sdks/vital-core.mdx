## Overview

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication
schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

## Accessing Vital API

You can access Vital API through `VitalClient` with typed request methods and response models.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
// e.g. Link Service
let linkService = VitalClient.shared.link
```
```kotlin Native Android
// e.g. Link Service
val linkService = VitalClient.getOrCreate(context).linkService
```
```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

vital_core.VitalClient client;

// For customers using Vital API Keys for early evaluation.
client = vital_core.VitalClient()
  ..init(region: Region.eu, environment: Environment.sandbox, apiKey: 'sk_eu_...');

// For customers using the Vital Sign-In Tokens scheme
client = vital_core.VitalClient.forSignedInUser(environment: Environment.sandbox, region: Region.eu);

// e.g. Link Service
final linkService = client.linkService;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>Typed API access is not yet available in React Native.</Info>

## Generating Vital Link URL

You can obtain an URL to the Vital Link Widget through `VitalClient.linkWidgetUrl`. Note that the URL contains
a short-lived token with 10-minute expiry.

For the `redirectUrl`, you should set it to a URL with a custom URL scheme which your app would register to handle.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let widgetUrl = await VitalClient.shared.link.createProviderLink(
  redirectURL: "x-vital-app://"
)
```
```dart Flutter
Uri widgetUrl = await client.linkWidgetUrl(redirectUrl: "x-vital-app://");
```
</CodeGroup>
