## Overview

Check out the [SDK Authentication guide](/wearables/sdks/authentication) on the available SDK authentication
schemes, and how to authenticate with the Vital Mobile SDK.

## Accessing Junction API

You can access Junction API through `VitalClient` with typed request methods and response models.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
// e.g. Link Service
let linkService = VitalClient.shared.link
```
```kotlin Native Android
// e.g. Link Service
val linkService = VitalClient.getOrCreate(context).linkService
```
```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

vital_core.VitalClient client;

// For customers using Junction Team API Keys for early evaluation.
client = vital_core.VitalClient()
  ..init(region: Region.eu, environment: Environment.sandbox, apiKey: 'sk_eu_...');

// For customers using the Vital Sign-In Tokens scheme
client = vital_core.VitalClient.forSignedInUser(environment: Environment.sandbox, region: Region.eu);

// e.g. Link Service
final linkService = client.linkService;
```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>Typed API access is not yet available in React Native.</Info>

## Generating Junction Link URL

You can obtain an URL to the Junction Link Widget through `VitalClient.linkWidgetUrl`. Note that the URL contains
a short-lived token with 10-minute expiry.

For the `redirectUrl`, you should set it to a URL with a custom URL scheme which your app would register to handle.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let widgetUrl = await VitalClient.shared.link.createProviderLink(
  redirectURL: "x-vital-app://"
)
```
```dart Flutter
Uri widgetUrl = await client.linkWidgetUrl(redirectUrl: "x-vital-app://");
```
</CodeGroup>

## Core SDK Status

You can inspect the status of the Core SDK for troubleshooting, as well as for your own business logic.
For example, you may reconcile your user session and the Vital SDK sign-in based on the Core SDK status.

The SDK normally reports one of the following status combinations:

| Combinations                                | Auth Scheme         | Remarks |
| ----                                        | ----                | ---- |
| _Empty_                                     | N/A                 | The SDK has neither been configured nor an active sign-in. |
| `Configured`                                | API Key             | The SDK has been configured, but does not have an active sign-in. |
| `Configured`, `SignedIn` & `UseApiKey`      | API Key             | The active sign-in was done by setting an API Key and a target Vital User ID. |
| `Configured`, `SignedIn` & `UseSignInToken` | Vital Sign-In Token | The active sign-in was done by consuming a Vital Sign-In Token. |

### Get the current status
<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  let status: VitalClient.Status = VitalClient.status
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext)
  val status = VitalClient.status
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  await VitalCore.status();
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  await vital_core.clientStatus();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Observe status changes over time
<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  // Combine Publisher
  let cancellable = VitalClient.statusDidChange.sink { _ in }

  // AsyncStream
  Task {
    for status in VitalClient.statuses {
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  val statuses: Flow<Set<VitalClient.Status>>
  statuses = VitalClient.statuses(applicationContext)

  val job = statuses
    .onEach { /** ... **/ }
    .launchIn(...)
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  VitalCore.observeStatusChange((statuses) => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  // NOTE: This stream does not yield the current statuses on listen.
  Stream<Set<ClientStatus>> statuses;
  statuses = vital_core.clientStatusStream;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Get Current Vital User ID

Aside from the Core SDK Status, you can also query the Vital User ID of the signed-in user:

<CodeGroup>
  ```swift Native iOS
  import VitalCore

  let userId: String? = VitalClient.currentUserId
  ```

  ```kotlin Native Android
  import io.tryvital.client.VitalClient
  import android.content.Context

  val applicationContext: Context

  VitalClient.getOrCreate(applicationContext)
  val userId = VitalClient.currentUserId
  ```

  ```typescript React Native
  import { VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

  const userId = await VitalCore.currentUserId();
  ```

  ```dart Flutter
  import 'package:vital_core/vital_core.dart' as vital_core;

  final userId = await vital_core.currentUserId();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Reset the SDK (Sign Out)

Refer to [the Sign Out section in the SDK Authentication guide](/wearables/sdks/authentication#sign-out).


## Verbose Logging to Console/Logcat

You can enable verbose logging to have a deeper look into how Vital Mobile SDK is reacting to your calls, as well as
all the automatic behaviours that the SDK is performing in background.

To avoid any missing log entry, you should enable verbose logging as early as possible â€” preferably before any usage of
any Vital Mobile SDKs.

<Note>
On Android, verbose logging is enabled by default when running as a debuggable build
(i.e., with `ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE`).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS (Swift)
import VitalCore

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil
  ) -> Bool {

    VitalLogger.stdOutEnabled = true

    // ...

    return true
  }
}
```

```objc Native iOS (Objective-C)
#import "AppDelegate.h"

@import VitalCore

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  VitalLoggerObjC.stdOutEnabled = YES;

  // ...

  return YES;
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.client.utils.VitalLogger

VitalLogger.getOrCreate().enabled = true
```
</CodeGroup>
