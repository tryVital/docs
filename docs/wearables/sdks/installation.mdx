## Setup package dependencies

## iOS

Vital Mobile SDKs are available through both Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods.

### Swift Package Manager

Add the vital-ios package (`https://github.com/tryVital/vital-ios`) as a dependency of your project.

Link `VitalHealthKit` and `VitalDevices` as appropriate. Note that `VitalCore` is mandatory.

### CocoaPods

Add the following declarations to your app target in your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'VitalCore'
pod 'VitalDevices'
pod 'VitalHealthKit'
```

## Android

Add the Sonatype OSS Release Maven repository to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
  ...
  maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/' }
}
```

Then include the Android SDK artifacts you need as dependencies of your app or library modules:

```groovy
def vital_version = '3.2.1'

implementation 'io.tryvital:vital-client:$vital_version'
implementation 'io.tryvital:vital-health-connect:$vital_version'
implementation 'io.tryvital:vital-devices:$vital_version'
```

## React Native

Install Vital SDK packages through NPM or Yarn:
```commandline
npm install @tryvital/vital-core-react-native
npm install @tryvital/vital-health-react-native
npm install @tryvital/vital-devices-react-native
```

Pull all dependencies for your React Native iOS project:
```commandline
cd ios
pod install
```

<Info>
`pod install` on your iOS project might error due to version lock conflicts on the Vital iOS libraries.
This usually happens after you have bumped the React Native SDK package versions.

Use `pod update` to resolve the conflict:
```commandline
pod update VitalCore VitalDevices VitalHealthKit --repo-update
```
</Info>

## Flutter

Add Vital SDK packages to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vital_core: ^3.1.1
  vital_health: ^3.1.1
  vital_devices: ^3.1.1
```

<Info>
`pod install` on your iOS project might error due to version lock conflicts on the Vital iOS libraries.
This usually happens after you have bumped the Flutter SDK package versions.

Use `pod update` to resolve the conflict:
```commandline
pod update VitalCore VitalDevices VitalHealthKit --repo-update
```
</Info>
