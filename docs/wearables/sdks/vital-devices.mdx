## Prerequisites

Your app project must declare the required permission usage. This applies equally to both native,
Flutter and React Native app projects.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="iOS projects">
  Add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

  ```xml
  <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data between different devices</string>
  ```

  Bluetooth permission on iOS is automatically requested on the first scanning attempt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Android projects">
  Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

  <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
  ```

  You will have to request the appropriate permissions at in your app before you can call the Vital Devices SDK.
  </Accordion>

## Bluetooth devices

### Choose Device Model

The SDK provides a list of supported Bluetooth devices. Select the matching instance to prepare for scanning.

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalDevices

let devicesManager = DevicesManager()

/// Get the brands
let brands = DevicesManager.brands()

/// Each brand has devices
let devices = DevicesManager.devices(for: brands[0])
```

```kotlin Native Android
import io.tryvital.vitaldevices.*

val deviceManager = VitalDeviceManager.create(context)

val deviceModels = devices(Brand.AccuChek)
val deviceModel = deviceModels[0]
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalDevicesManager } from "@tryvital/vital-devices-react-native";

const devicesManager = new VitalDevicesManager();

let deviceModels = VitalDevicesManager.supportedDevices;
let deviceModel = deviceModels[0];
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:vital_devices/vital_devices.dart';

final deviceManager = DeviceManager();

final deviceModels = await deviceManager.getDevices(Brand.accuChek);
final deviceModel = deviceModels[0];
```
</CodeGroup>

### Scanning for devices

First you have to scan for one of the supported devices. 

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let cancellable = devicesManager
  .search(for: state.device)
  .sink { scannedDevice in
    print("Discovered: \(scannedDevice)")
  }

// Stop scanning
cancellable.cancel()
```

```kotlin Native Android
val job = deviceManager
  .search(deviceModel)
  .catch {
      Log.i("Devices", "Error scanning ${it.message}", it.cause)
  }
  .onEach { scannedDevice ->
      Log.i("Devices", "Discovered ${scannedDevice}")
  }
  .launchIn(Dispatchers.Main)

// Stop scanning
job.cancel()
```

```typescript React Native
let scanner = deviceManager.scanForDevice(deviceModel, {
    onDiscovered: (device) => {
        console.log("Discovered: " + device)
    },
    onError: (error) => console.log(error)
})

// Stop scanning
scanner.cancel()
```

```dart Flutter
deviceManager.scanForDevices(deviceModel).listen((newDevice) {
  Fimber.i("Discovered: $newDevice");
});

// Stop scanning
await deviceManager.stopScan();
```
</CodeGroup>

Depending on the type of device you are connecting to, you will have to call different methods to connect to it.

### Blood Pressure Monitor

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let scannedDevice: ScannedDevice
let reader = deviceManager.bloodPressureReader(for: scannedDevice)

reader.read(device: scannedDevice).sink { samples in
  print("Read samples: \(samples)")
}
```

```kotlin Native Android
val scannedDevice: ScannedDevice

val samples = deviceManager.bloodPressure(context, scannedDevice).read()
```

```typescript React Native
let scannedDevice: ScannedDevice

let samples = await devicesManager.readBloodPressure(scannedDevice.id)
```

```dart Flutter
List<BloodPressureSample> bloodPressureSamples;
bloodPressureSamples = await deviceManager.readBloodPressureData(scannedDevice);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Glucose Meter

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let scannedDevice: ScannedDevice
let reader = deviceManager.glucoseMeter(for: scannedDevice)

reader.read(device: scannedDevice).sink { samples in
  print("Read samples: \(samples)")
}
```
```kotlin Native Android
val scannedDevice: ScannedDevice

val samples = deviceManager.glucoseMeter(context, scannedDevice).read()
```
```typescript React Native
let scannedDevice: ScannedDevice

let samples = await devicesManager.readGlucoseMeter(scannedDevice.id)
```
```dart Flutter
List<QuantitySample> glucoseSamples;
glucoseSamples = await deviceManager.readGlucoseMeterData(scannedDevice);
```
</CodeGroup>

After you have received samples depending on the type of device you might need to star scanning again to receive the
next set of samples.

## Freestyle Libre 1

<Warning>
  Readings taken with the SDK are not guaranteed to match the official Freestyle
  Libre app. This mismatch happens due to the algorithm difference used by us,
  compared to the official Freestyle Libre.
</Warning>

We currently support Libre 1 sensors via NFC readings. Please make sure you add NFC capabilities in your app:

<img src="/img/iOS/nfc_permission.png" />

Also add the key `NFCReaderUsageDescription` in your info.plist. This key should explain why your app needs to use NFC.

To use the reader:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
let reader = Libre1Reader(
    readingMessage: "Ready for reading",
    errorMessage: "Failed reading from sensor",
    completionMessage: "Completed successfully!",
    queue: mainQueue
)

let reading = try await reader.read()
```

```kotlin Native Android
import android.app.Activity
import io.tryvital.vitaldevices.devices.Libre1Reader

let currentActivity: Activity

val reading = Libre1Reader.create(currentActivity).read()
```

```typescript React Native
import { VitalDevicesManager } from "@tryvital/vital-devices-react-native";

let devicesManager: VitalDeviceManager

let result = await devicesManager.readLibre1("reading", "errored", "completed")
```
</CodeGroup>

`read()` returns a result object with two fields:

1. the sensor information; and
2. a list of glucose samples.

## Posting device samples to Vital

Vital Devices SDK does not automatically send the samples back to Vital data store.

To ensure that data are available, you would need to post the samples through the SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Native iOS
import VitalCore

let samples: [QuantitySample]

try await VitalClient.shared.timeSeries.post(
  .glucose(samples),
  stage: .daily,
  provider: .libre,
  timeZone: .current
)
```

```kotlin Native Android
import android.content.Context
import io.tryvital.client.*
import io.tryvital.client.services.data.*

val samples: List<QuantitySamplePayload>
val context: android.content.Context

val client = VitalClient.getOrCreate(context)

await client.createConnectedSourceIfNotExist(ManualProviderSlug.LibreBLE)

// NOTE:
// For Blood Pressure, use `client.vitalsService.sendBloodPressure`.

await client.vitalsService.sendQuantitySamples(
    IngestibleTimeseriesResource.BloodGlucose,
    VitalClient.currentUserId!!,
    timeseriesPayload= TimeseriesPayload(
        stage = DataStage.Daily,
        provider = ManualProviderSlug.LibreBLE,
        startDate = null,
        endDate = null,
        timeZoneId = TimeZone.getDefault().id,
        data = samples,
    )
)
```

```typescript React Native
import { ManualProviderSlug, QuantitySample, VitalCore } from "@tryvital/vital-core-react-native";

let samples: QuantitySample[]

await VitalCore.createConnectedSourceIfNotExist(ManualProviderSlug.LibreBLE)
await VitalCore.postTimeSeriesData(
    { "type": "glucose", "samples": samples },
    ManualProviderSlug.LibreBLE
)
```
</CodeGroup>
