Vital fetches the historical data immediately when the connection is established. The pull range
can be estimated by `[now - days_to_pull, now]`.

### Customizing historical data pull range

<OrgManagementAPI />

You can configure the historical pull range using the [Team Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences)
feature of the Org Management API.

You can specify a number of days to backfill that uniformly applies to all resources of a provider, as well as overriding the
the number of days to backfill for specific resources.

<Info>
The Team Data Pull Preferences you specified is _advisory_. There are scenarios in which Vital systems
may not adhere strictly to your stated preferences.
