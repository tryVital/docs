## Overview

There are two broad resource categories provided by Vital:

* A **Summary** type is a summarization of a specific calendar day or a session.
* A **Timeseries** type is a time-ordered collection of data samples.

There is no relation in resource availability among these two categories. Some providers do offer both,
while some providers offer only one category. For example:

* Fitbit provides daily activity summaries, as well as **some** high-frequency activity timeseries data.
* Oura provides only daily activity summary, without any complementary high-frequency activity timeseries data.

There is also no strict relation between a field in a _Summary_ type and a _Timeseries_ type.
For example:

* The existence of a `sleep_efficiency` summary field does not imply that there is a corresponding `sleep_efficiency` timeseries.
* The existence of a Glucose Timeseries type does not imply that there is a corresponding `glucose` summary field.
* A _Timeseries_ type could derive multiple summary fields, e.g., heart rate statistics and HR zones.


### Summary types

| Granularity | Resources       |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Daily       | `activity` |
| Session     | `sleep`, `workouts`, `body`, `meal`, `menstrual_cycle`, `workout_stream`, `sleep_stream` |
| Single      | `profile` |

### Discrete Timeseries types

Each value is associated with a single point in time.

| Category          | Resources |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Cardiorespiratory | `respiratory_rate` |
| Vitals            | `blood_oxygen`, `blood_pressure`, `glucose`, `heartrate`, `hrv` |
| Wellness          | `stress_level` |
| Body              | `fat`, `weight` |
| Lab Testing       | `cholesterol`, `igg`, `ige` |

### Interval Timeseries types

Each value is associated with a half-open time interval (`[start, end[`).

| Category          | Resources |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Activity          | `calories_active`, `calories_basal`, `distance`, `floors_climbed`, `steps` |
| Body              | `body_temperature`, `body_temperature_delta` |
| Cardiorespiratory | `vo2_max` |
| Sleep             | `hypnogram` |
| Nutrition         | `water`, `caffeine` |
| Wellness          | `mindfulness_minutes` |

## Fetching via the API

<Tip>

Summary resources can be fetched from our `/summary/<resource>/<user_id>` API, while everything else via `/timeseries/<user_id>/<resource>`.

</Tip>

For example, `Workouts` is made up of fields specific to an workout, like calories, distance and duration. When you make a request to `/summary/workouts/<user_id>` you get the following fields:

```json
{
  "workouts": [
    {
      "user_id": "a6fea8eb-402f-4578-96ba-189df1a8ca75",
      "user_key": "a6fea8eb-402f-4578-96ba-189df1a8ca75",
      "id": "12398c74-ea41-4d9c-a1b7-8c529ee67e46",
      "title": null,
      "timezone_offset": 3600,
      "average_hr": 147,
      "max_hr": 178,
      "distance": 31557.85,
      "time_start": "2022-07-29T12:05:49+00:00",
      "time_end": "2022-07-29T13:26:08+00:00",
      "calories": 729.0,
      "sport": {
        "id": 108,
        "name": "Road Biking",
        "slug": "road_biking"
      },
      "hr_zones": [
        5,
        76,
        288,
        1467,
        2148,
        835
      ],
      "moving_time": 4819,
      "total_elevation_gain": 374.0,
      "elev_high": null,
      "elev_low": null,
      "average_speed": 6.548,
      "max_speed": 17.448,
      "average_watts": null,
      "device_watts": null,
      "max_watts": null,
      "weighted_average_watts": null,
      "map": null,
      "provider_id": "9297103021",
      "source": {
        "name": "Garmin",
        "slug": "garmin",
        "logo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/vital-assets/garmin.png"
      }
    }
}
```

`Heartrate` on the other hand, is a timeseries resources. You can fetch it via `timeseries/<user_id>/heartrate` and looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2022-04-29T08:35:57+00:00",
    "timezone_offset": 3600,
    "value": 174.0,
    "type": null,
    "unit": "bpm"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2022-04-30T11:22:38+00:00",
    "timezone_offset": 3600,
    "value": 79.0,
    "type": null,
    "unit": "bpm"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2022-04-30T11:22:39+00:00",
    "timezone_offset": 3600,
    "value": 80.0,
    "type": null,
    "unit": "bpm"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2022-04-30T11:22:40+00:00",
    "timezone_offset": 3600,
    "value": 78.0,
    "type": null,
    "unit": "bpm"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2022-04-30T11:22:41+00:00",
    "timezone_offset": 3600,
    "value": 78.0,
    "type": null,
    "unit": "bpm"
  }
]
```

Different providers (e.g. Garmin), have different resources available. As an example, Garmin doesn't have `Glucose` as a resource.


## Fields by Provider

Resources alone are not the whole story. Depending on the provider, a field might not be available. For example both Garmin and Strava provide `Workouts`, yet the former doesn't have `ele_high` nor `ele_low`.

<Note>

Providers mark with `*` means that Vital calculates the field's value. In some cases, they might came as `null`, since we weren't able to make the calculation.

</Note>

<Warning>

Even if a field is available for a provider, it doesn't mean it's available. For example, Fitbit is capable of generating HRV data. However HRV data is only available for specific high-end devices. Another common scenario is Apple HealthKit data. If the user doesn't give permission to a particular field, it won't be available. **Be mindful of these situations and similar ones**.
