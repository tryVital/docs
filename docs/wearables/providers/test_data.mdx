title: "Test data"
description: "Using demo users to build and test your Vital integration"
---

<Note>
This feature is currently under development for the following providers:

* Apple Health Kit
* Fitbit
* Oura
* Whoop

The others will be coming soon. If there is a particular provider you would like us to add
please do not hesitate to contact us at support@tryvital.io!
</Note>

When integrating with Vital, you may not own a physical device for each provider you're planning to support. For this, we provide demo users with test data so you can build and test the whole integration without touching a real device.

A demo user gives you the same experience as using a real one, the only difference is that you won't go through the [Vital Link](/wearables/vital-link/introduction) flow.

## Usage

First, you need a Vital user. You can create one either through the [dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io) or through the [API](/api-reference/user/create-user).

After creating the user, the `Users` page of your dashboard will look like this:

<img src="../../img/test_data_dashboard_before_connection.png" width={"100%"} />

Now you can create a demo connection for the Vital user you just created, in this case `150db84c-537c-4cad-a6e9-24dc589d7fa2`. You can directly hit the [API endpoint](/api-reference/link/link-demo-provider) or using one of our client libraries, as shown below:

<SnippetGroup>

```bash Creating a demo connection
curl --request POST \
     --url {{BASE_URL}}/v2/link/connect/demo \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-vital-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
     --data '{"user_id": "<user_id>", "provider": "<provider>"}'
```

```js Node
const { VitalClient } = require("Vital");

const client = new VitalClient({
  api_key: <API_KEY>,
  environment: "sandbox",
  region: "us"
});

const response = await client.Link.connectDemoProvider(userId, provider);
```

```python Python
from vital import Client

client = Client(
  api_key=<API_KEY>,
  environment="sandbox",
  region="us"
)

response = client.Link.demo_provider(user_id, provider)
```

</SnippetGroup>

After the demo connection is created, a Fitbit logo will appear beside your user.

<img src="../../img/test_data_dashboard_after_connection.png" width={"100%"} />

From here, everything works exactly the same as if you connected a real device. This means you will receive the following webhook updates:

* [Connection created](/webhooks/data_flow#connection-created), as soon as the connection is created.
* [Historical webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#historical-data-flow). We simulate historical data for the demo device and send the corresponding webhook updates, as in the real-world scenario.
* [Daily webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#daily-data-flow). We also simulate updates to the device data every couple of hours so you can test receiving the data when a user recorded a workout or other activity.
* [Refresh user data](/api-reference/user/refresh-user-data). You can also instantaneously refresh a user's data through this endpoint.
