title: "Test data"
description: "Using demo users to build and test your Vital integration"
---

<Note>
This feature is currently under development for the following providers:

- Apple Health Kit
- Fitbit
- Oura
- Freestyle Libre

The others will be coming soon. If there is a particular provider you would like us to add
please do not hesitate to contact us at support@tryvital.io!

</Note>

When integrating with Vital, you may not own a physical device for each provider you're planning to support. For this, we provide demo users with test data so you can build and test the whole integration without touching a real device.

A demo user gives you the same experience as using a real one, the only difference is that you won't go through the [Vital Link](/wearables/vital-link/introduction) flow.

## Usage

First, you need a Vital user. You can create one either through the [dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io) or through the [API](/api-reference/user/create-user).

After creating the user, the `Users` page of your dashboard will look like this:

<img src="/img/test_data_dashboard_before_connection.png" width={"100%"} />

Now you can create a demo connection for the Vital user you just created, in this case `150db84c-537c-4cad-a6e9-24dc589d7fa2`. You can directly hit the [API endpoint](/api-reference/link/link-demo-provider) or using one of our client libraries, as shown below:

<SnippetGroup>

```bash Creating a demo connection
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.sandbox.tryvital.io/v2/link/connect/demo \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-vital-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
     --data '{"user_id": "<user_id>", "provider": "<provider>"}'
```

```js Node
const { VitalClient } = require("Vital");

const client = new VitalClient({
  api_key: <API_KEY>,
  environment: "sandbox",
  region: "us"
});

const response = await client.Link.connectDemoProvider(userId, provider);
```

```python Python
from vital import Client

client = Client(
  api_key=<API_KEY>,
  environment="sandbox",
  region="us"
)

response = client.Link.demo_provider(user_id, provider)
```

</SnippetGroup>

After the demo connection is created, a Fitbit logo will appear beside your user.

<img src="/img/test_data_dashboard_after_connection.png" width={"100%"} />

From here, everything works exactly the same as if you connected a real device. This means you will receive the following webhook updates:

- [Connection created](/webhooks/data_flow#connection-created), as soon as the connection is created.
- [Historical webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#historical-data-flow). We simulate historical data for the demo device and send the corresponding webhook updates, as in the real-world scenario.
- [Daily webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#daily-data-flow). We also simulate updates to the device data every couple of hours so you can test receiving the data when a user recorded a workout or other activity.
- [Refresh user data](/api-reference/user/refresh-user-data). You can also instantaneously refresh a user's data through this endpoint.

## Backfill Data

For demo connections there will be 30 days of historic data backfilled. This is in contrast with data backfill for non demo providers,
where the number of days data backfilled varies according to the provider. You can find out more [here](/wearables/providers/introduction#historical-days-retrieved)

## Data Format

When connecting to the live Vital client, there are three data response structures available for data.
Raw, Stream and Summary

When connecting to the demo Vital client data is only available in the Summary structure.

Summary restructures provider data fields, to have a consistent response structure across all providers.
This is the easiest way to use provider data across an application which connects to multiple providers.
