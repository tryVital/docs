## Timestamps

All Vital data timestamps are formatted using [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) as follows:

| Providers       | Time Basis    | Pattern                                 |
| --------------- | ------------  | --------------------------------------- |
| Freestyle Libre | Floating Time | `YYYY-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss` (No TZ specifier) |
| _Everyone else_ | UTC           | `YYYY-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss+00:00`             |

<Info>
Some older teams may see Freestyle Libre data timestamps with the `+00:00` misnomer.
Please update your system to handle the format as stated. Once done, you can contact Vital support to
disable the TZ specifier.
</Info>


## Time Zones

Vital formats time zones in data as a _nullable_ integer offset to UTC:

* A positive offset indicates east of UTC.
* A negative offset indicates west of UTC.
* `null` indicates the time zone information is absent.

Each provider has their own affinity of time zone information:

| Affinity                    | Time Basis    | Time Zone |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| ✅                          | UTC           | The data comes with time zone information. |
| User Fallback, or UTC       | UTC           | We assume the data were captured in the [User Fallback Time Zone](#user-fallback-time-zone). We fallback to UTC if the former is not set. |
| User Fallback, or Absent    | UTC           | We assume the data were captured in the [User Fallback Time Zone](#user-fallback-time-zone). Mark as no time zone (`null`) if the former is not set. |
| Inferred, or Absent         | UTC           | We infer the time zone from the data. Mark as no time zone (`null`) if the inferrence fails. |
| Absent                      | UTC           | We do not know the exact time zone the recording took place in. Mark as no time zone (`null`). |
| Floating Time               | Floating Time | We do not know the exact time zone the recording took place in. Mark as no time zone (`null`). |

### SDK-based Providers

<Info>
On-device data often do not capture the time zone at recording time.
Vital SDK uses the device's current time zone as the fallback of closest approximation.

## Examples

The data point was recorded on July 7, 2023 at 1:00 PM in UTC-07:00.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-07T20:00:00+00:00",
  "timezone_offset": -25200
}
```

The data point was timestamped to Aug 13, 2023 at 8:12 AM in UTC+00:00 (Zulu).
We do not know the exact time zone the recording took place in.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-08-13T08:12:00+00:00",
  "timezone_offset": null
}
```

The data point was recorded on Sep 27, 2023 at 7:48 AM in floating time (whichever time zone the user was in).
We do not know the exact time zone the recording took place in.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-08-13T07:48:00",
  "timezone_offset": null
}
```

## User Fallback Time Zone

Some providers neither expose nor even capture time zone information at source. So Vital can only request data and interpret them strictly in UTC.

If you prefer the data to be contextualize to the geographical location of a user, a Fallback Time Zone (denoted by an [IANA tz database identifier](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html))
can be specified on a per-user basis. Once specified, Vital would use the time zone to pull data and interpret timestamps from any time zone unware providers from that point onwards. 

You can specify the Fallback Time Zone when:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or
* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)

You will also get information about the source (by slug) and the last updated time of the Fallback Time Zone [when getting an existing user](/api-reference/user/get-user). Fallback Time Zone manually supplied via the REST API would always have a source slug of `manual`.

```json Example
{
  "user_id": "409d9870-21fb-443a-8daa-c5222659f40e",
  "team_id": "3aac677c-557f-40b7-9251-0315c1f48e77",
  "client_user_id": "d734e32e-dd43-4b77-ab56-692524279531",
  /** snipped **/
  "fallback_time_zone": {
    "id": "Europe/London",
    "source_slug": "manual",
    "updated_at": "2022-09-11T13:45:56+00:00"
  }
}
```
