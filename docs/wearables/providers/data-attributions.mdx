## Source Type

For summary data types, you can identify the Source Type through `source.type`. This is available in both summary data events and API responses.

For timeseries data types:

* You can identify the Source Type through `$.data.source.type` in timeseries data events you received.
* You can request timeseries data grouped by their Source Type through [the Grouped Timeseries Data API](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/steps).
