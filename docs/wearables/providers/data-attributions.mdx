## Source Type

For summary data types, you can identify the Source Type through `source.type`. This is available in both summary data events and API responses.

For timeseries data types:

* You can identify the Source Type through `$.data.source.type` in timeseries data events you received.
* You can request timeseries data grouped by their Source Type through [the Grouped Timeseries Data API](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/steps).


### Common

| Source Type        | Description  |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| `unknown`          | The default value. Vital does not know how the provider collects this data. |
| `app`              | The user manually enters this data through an app.   |
| `multiple_sources` | This data is derived from multiple sources. |

### Wearables

| Source Type        | Description  |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| `watch`            | A smart watch collects this data automatically. |
| `phone`            | A smart phone collects this data automatically. |
| `ring`             | A smart ring collects this data automatically.  |
| `chest_strap`      | A smart chest strap collects this data automatically.  |

### Health devices

| Source Type        | Description  |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| `manual_scan`      | A biosensor that needs to be manually scanned. |
| `automatic`        | A biosensor that uploads data continuously in background. |
| `fingerprick`      | A glucose testing device which analyzes fingerprick blood samples. |
| `cuff`             | A blood pressure cuff. |

### Supported providers

The following provider integrations would tag data with Source Type:

| Provider        | Source Types |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apple HealthKit | `phone`, `watch`, `app`, `multiple_sources`, `unknown` [1] |
| Fitbit          | `watch`, `scale`, `app`, `multiple_sources` |
| Oura            | `ring`, `app`, `multiple_sources` |
| Garmin          | `watch`, `scale`, `cuff`, `app`, `multiple_sources` |
| Freestyle Libre | `automatic`, `manual_scan` |

<sup>[1]</sup> Only data from Apple Watch, iPhone and Apple Health app are tagged. Data from third-party apps
(like the Oura iOS app) are tagged as `unknown` currently.

## Device ID

Device ID indicates the specific device that collected the data, when this information is available with certainty.

For both summary and timeseries data types, it is available at `source.device_id`. When the originating device cannot be determined, this field is `null`.

### Device Attribution Coverage

Device attribution is available when Junction can confidently identify the originating device:

| Provider        | Coverage | Notes |
| --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Withings        | All payloads except Body, Body Fat and Body Weight | Regardless of the number of registered devices |
| Polar           | Workout and Sleep payloads | Regardless of the number of registered devices |
| All other providers and resources| All payloads | When exactly one device is registered for the user-provider connection |

For connections with multiple devices where the provider doesn't embed device metadata, `source.device_id` remains `null` to avoid incorrect attribution.

### Supported providers

The following provider integrations can provide Device ID attribution:

| Provider               |
| ---------------------- |
| Withings               |
| Polar                  |

## App ID

App ID indicates the origin application of the data.

| Provider               | Remarks |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| Apple HealthKit        | App Store Bundle ID, or Unique Device ID (`com.apple.health.{UUID}`) for first-party data |
| Android Health Connect | Android Application Package Name |

## Workout ID

If a Workout ID is present, the data are associated with the referenced Junction [Workout](/api-reference/data/workouts/get-summary) summary.

Workout ID is only available in the following Workout Stream timeseries resources (`workout_*`):

Resource | Remarks
-------- | -------
`workout_distance`        | All data must have an associated Workout ID and Sport.
`workout_swimming_stroke` | All data must have an associated Workout ID and Sport.

### Supported providers

The following provider integrations would tag data with Workout ID:

| Provider               |
| ---------------------- |
| Apple HealthKit        |


## Sport

If a sport slug is present, the data are known to be measuring the referenced Sport type.
