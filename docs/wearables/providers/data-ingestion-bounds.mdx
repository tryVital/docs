title: "Data Ingestion Bounds"
---

## Overview

By default, Vital:

* pulls historical data as far back as indicated by the [pull preferences](/wearables/providers/introduction#customizing-historical-data-pull-range)
  you specified (if any), or the [default historical pull range](/wearables/providers/introduction#historical-data-pull-range).

* accepts **all** new and changed data discovered through polling, incoming provider webhooks and Vital Mobile SDK integrations.

If you need to impose a date bounds on the data being collected, you can set **data ingestion bounds** on a per-user basis:

* The data ingestion bounds restricts the historical pull range of any new connections of the user.

* The data ingestion bounds restricts data ingestion from any connections of the user — out of bound data are dropped.

* When the user ingestion end date is reached, a 7-day late delivery catchment period starts. Once the catchment
  period expires, all connections of the user are automatically de-registered and marked as _paused_.

<Note>
Because _dates_ are in floating time, you should expect an error margin of ±1 days on ingestion bound enforcement.
If you cannot tolerate an error margin, offset the user data ingestion bounds you set accordingly.
</Note>

##  Setting Ingestion Start and End Dates

You can specify the user data ingestion bounds (`ingestion_start` and `ingestion_end`) when you:

* [Create a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or

* [Update an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)


```json Example
{
  "user_id": "409d9870-21fb-443a-8daa-c5222659f40e",
  "team_id": "3aac677c-557f-40b7-9251-0315c1f48e77",
  "client_user_id": "d734e32e-dd43-4b77-ab56-692524279531",
  /** snipped **/
  "ingestion_start": "2024-01-01",
  "ingestion_end": "2024-12-15",
}
```


## Changing Ingestion Bounds

You can change the ingestion bounds at any time.

However, do note that it has no retrospective effect on data already ingested — Vital does not delete collected data
in response to ingestion bound changes.

As long as the connection has not been marked as _paused_, you can change the ingestion end date to extend the ingestion
bounds at any time, even during the (post ingestion end) 7-day late delivery catchment period.

Otherwise, the ingestion end date has no effect on any _paused_ cloud-based connections — since these connections have been
deregistered with the data provider, the end user needs to go through the Vital Link flow to re-connect.
