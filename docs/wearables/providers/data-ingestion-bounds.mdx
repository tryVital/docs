title: "Data Ingestion Bounds"
---

## Data collection time bounds

By default, all user connections in Vital system have no data collection time bounds set. 
Vital will fetch historical data up to the provider's [limit](/wearables/providers/introduction#historical-days-retrieved) and continue to fetch new data daily until the connection is deregistered.

##  Setting Ingestion Start and End Dates

You can set and update the Ingestion Start and End Dates during:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or

* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)


<Info>
If no ingestion bounds are set, data will be fetched continuously without any restrictions
