title: "Heart Rate Zones"

## Heart Rate Zones Calculation

Heart rate zones are segments in a workout session. They are based on the percentage brackets of the user's maximum heart rate. [under 50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, above 90%]

The maximum heart rate for a person is calculated with a straightforward formula: `220 - age`.

##  Fallback Birth Date

Some providers may not share the user's birth date, making it impossible for Vital to know the user's age. To solve this, users can provide a Fallback Birth Date as an alternative option.

You can specify the Fallback Birth Date when:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or

* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)

You will also get information about the source (by slug) and the last updated time of the Fallback Birth Date [when getting an existing user](/api-reference/user/get-user). 

Fallback Birth Date supplied via the REST API would always have a source slug of `manual`.


<Info>
If no birth date information is available, the assumed age of 30 is used in the calculations.
