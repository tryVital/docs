## Cloud Based Providers

<Note>
  Some OAuth providers are unavailable unless you can <b>[Bring Your Own OAuth (BYOO)](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring_your_own_oauth)</b>.
  You will have to apply directly to the provider for an OAuth application, and

## Data Frequency

Whenever Vital detects that new data is available, [data events](/event-catalog) are always sent to your configured endpoints, regardless of the provider being push-based or polling-based.

### Cloud Based Providers

Cloud Based Providers can be divided in two main categories:

- Push-based

  - When a cloud-based provider supports a push notify mechanism (typically webhooks), Vital would prefer to use it to drive data fetches. In other words, as soon as the provider notifies Vital of new data through the said mechanism, Vital fetches the latest data.

- Polling-based

  - For providers and/or resources without any push notify mechanism, Vital polls these resources at a regular schedule, typically every 15 minutes or so.

| Provider                                                        | Description |

### SDK Based Providers

SDK Based Providers are all push-based, where data are pushed from the Vital SDK embedded inside your Android or iOS app.

For more information on Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect, please refer to the specific guides:

* [Android Health Connect: Sync Frequency](/wearables/guides/android-health-connect#sync-frequency)


## Historical Data Pull Range

Vital fetches the historical data immediately when the connection is established. The pull range
can be estimated by `[now - days_to_pull, now]`. 

<HistoricalPullLimitTable />


### Customizing historical data pull range

<OrgManagementAPI />

You can configure the historical pull range using the [Team Data Pull Preferences](/api-reference/org-management/team-data-pull-preferences/upsert-team-data-pull-preferences)
feature of the Org Management API.

You can specify a number of days to backfill that uniformly applies to all resources of a provider, as well as overriding the
the number of days to backfill for specific resources.

<Info>
The Team Data Pull Preferences you specified is _advisory_. There are scenarios in which Vital systems
may not adhere strictly to your stated preferences.
