## Data Frequency

Whenever Vital detects that new data is available, [data events](/event-catalog) are always sent to your configured endpoints, regardless of the provider being push-based or polling-based.

### Cloud Based Providers

Cloud Based Providers can be divided in two main categories:

- Push-based

  - When a cloud-based provider supports a push notify mechanism (typically webhooks), Vital would prefer to use it to drive data fetches. In other words, as soon as the provider notifies Vital of new data through the said mechanism, Vital fetches the latest data.

- Polling-based

  - For providers and/or resources without any push notify mechanism, Vital polls these resources at a regular schedule, typically every 15 minutes or so.

| Provider                                                        | Description |

## Historical Days Retrieved

When a new provider is connected to a user, Vital retrieves the historical data for this user from the connected provider. The following number of historical days of data are retrieved for each provider:
