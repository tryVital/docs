### Cloud Based Providers

<Note>
  Some Oauth providers are unavailable unless you can{" "}
  <b>
    [Bring Your Own OAuth
    (BYOO)](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring_your_own_oauth)

  â€” you will have to apply directly to the provider for an OAuth application, and
  provide Vital your assigned credentials once the application is accepted.

## Data Frequency

Whenever Vital detects that new data is available, [data events](/event-catalog) are always sent to your configured endpoints, regardless of the provider being push-based or polling-based.

### Cloud Based Providers

Cloud Based Providers can be divided in two main categories:

- Push-based

  - When a cloud-based provider supports a push notify mechanism (typically webhooks), Vital would prefer to use it to drive data fetches. In other words, as soon as the provider notifies Vital of new data through the said mechanism, Vital fetches the latest data.

- Polling-based

  - For providers and/or resources without any push notify mechanism, Vital polls these resources at a regular schedule, typically every 15 minutes or so.

| Provider                                                        | Description |

### SDK Based Providers

SDK Based Providers are all push-based, where data are pushed from the Vital SDK embedded inside your Android or iOS app.

| Provider                                                               | Description                                     |

<Warning>
[1] Notes on Sync on OS notification:

Apple HealthKit notifies new data immediately only when your iOS app is in the foreground with visible UI.

Meanwhile, [properly configured](/wearables/guides/apple_health_kit) HealthKit apps in background with no visible UI are
notified on an OS-throttled, opportunistic schedule that can dynamically change based on factors like CPU usage, battery usage,
connectivity, Low Power Mode, and delivery history.

The Vital SDK â€” or any third-party HealthKit apps â€” has no control over this, other than _suggesting_
a background delivery frequency to the OS as the lower bound. The actual delivery frequency
remains at full discretion of the OS, and can range from hourly, to once a day, or
when certain opportunity arises (e.g., when Sleep Mode ends, or when the phone starts charging).

Therefore, it is not recommended to base your UX around immediate availability of HealthKit data. The only exception
is if your UX do involve the user actively using your iOS app. For example, iOS 17+ supports third-party apps initiating
an Apple Watch workout session that would be live synced with your iPhone app.

</Warning>

<Warning>
[2] Notes on Sync On App Launch:

Because Android Health Connect disallowes any data access when the app is in background, your app
must be regularly opened by the end user for data to be synchronized. Hence, the Vital SDK can only
provide Sync On App Launch as the default automatic behaviour.

If automatic background monitoring is desired, your app would have to implement one of the [Android Foreground Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#background-start-restriction-exemptions)
â€” e.g. high priority push from Firebase Cloud Messaging â€” during which your service manually initiate a Vital SDK sync.

</Warning>

## Historical Days Retrieved

When a new provider is connected to a user, Vital retrieves the historical data for this user from the connected provider. The following number of historical days of data are retrieved for each provider:
