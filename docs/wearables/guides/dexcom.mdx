## Enabling Dexcom Share

Your user needs to enable [Dexcom Share](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/how-do-i-share-my-dexcom-g6-glucose-data-followers) for this connection to work:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Dexcom mobile app">
They **must** use the Dexcom G6 mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dexcom-g6/id1209262925), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dexcom.g6)).

Note that the Dexcom Clarity app would not work for this integration.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Dexcom Share">
Please refer to the [official help article on how to enable Dexcom Share](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/how-do-i-share-my-dexcom-g6-glucose-data-followers).

They **must** have at least one follower<sup>[1]</sup> on Dexcom Share to keep the sharing activated. Otherwise, the API would
stop reporting data to Vital.

<Info>
<sup>[1]</sup> You can setup your own Dexcom account for your user to add as a follower in the Dexcom G6 mobile app.
Alternatively, your user can invite `support@tryvital.io` as a follower.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect via Junction Link">
They **must** connect to Vital using their _own_ Dexcom account â€” the one which their Dexcom G6 app is signed into.
This should **not** be the accounts of the followers.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Vital Widget

To connect your device with the *widget*, follow the link wizard ensuring and enter your username and password.

## Junction Link

You can also connect a Dexcom user to vital using vital client. For additional information please consult the API reference.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
link_token = client.Link.create(user_id)
client.Link.password_provider(
    link_token, "dexcom", username, password
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const { link_token } = await client.Link.create(user_id);
await client.Link.password_provider(
    link_token, "dexcom", username, password
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Webhooks

On successful connection, you will receive a [Connection create](/webhooks/data_flow#connection-created) wehbook. [Daily webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#daily-data-flow) `data.daily.glucose.created` and `data.daily.glucose.updated` will also be issued to your team as new or more up-to-date data becomes available during the day.

For this provider however, Vital will begin to aggregate the data for the last 24 hours and will not go beyond that. As a result, there will be no [Historical webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#historical-data-flow) issued. If you would like to pull the data immediately after connection, you can use the `user/refresh` endpoint.
