<Warning>

Libre's API does not record the timestamp's offset associated with a user's reading.
Although Vital returns timestamps in the UTC format (e.g. `2022-04-20T13:02:01+00:00`) this doesn't hold true for Libre. The time returned is the user's timezone when they took a reading. Our recommendation is for you to record the timezone offset
of each user and adjust the timestamps accordingly.

</Warning>

## Adding users to a Practice

When integrating with Vital, you have two options: use Vital's practice, or yours. We call the latter a custom practice. Depending on the approach, you need to instruct your user's to connect their Libre account to a practice.

This allows Vital to start pulling data from their account. This is done through the Libre app:

### Custom Practice (Enterprise only)

<Warning>
  If you want to use a Custom Practice, you need an Enterprise Account. Please
  contact support@tryvital.io.
</Warning>

<Info>
Please make sure you invite Vital to your practice as a clinician with admin rights. To connect a user to Vital you must first connect your Freestyle practice to Vital in the appropriate Vital region for your Freestyle account.

If you get stuck at any point join our Slack channel or send us a message to support@tryvital.io

</Info>

Freestyle Libre is available in different regions, ensure you invite the correct email as an admin of your practice:

**Vital US Region**

| Freestyle Region                               |

| United States (`us`) \*                        | 
| Canada (`ca`)                                  | 
| _(\*) Default Freestyle region if unspecified_ |

**Vital EU Region**

| ---------------------------------------------- | 
| Europe (`eu`) \*                               |

| Brazil (`br`)                                  | 
| _(\*) Default Freestyle region if unspecified_ |

### Vital Practices

<Info>
  You can use a Vital practices to test the integration with Freestyle Libre.
  This modality is available to all subscriptions.
</Info>

Vital has two practices (depending on environment) this applies to all regions:

| Environment | Practice Name    |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Sandbox     | tryVital-sandbox |
| Production  | tryVital         |

You need to ask your user to add one of the above practices in their Libre App. Once that's done, data will start flowing.

## Vital Widget

To connect your user to Vital via the Widget you can follow the guide [here](/wearables/connecting-providers/launching_link).

<img src="/img/libre_connect.png" className="w-2/5 block mx-auto" />

## Vital Link

1. To connect to Freestyle Libre, you must create a Vital Link token.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
token_response = client.link.token(user_id="<user_id>")
```

```javascript Node
const request: LinkTokenExchange = {
    userId: "<user_id>",
}
const data = await client.link.token(request)
```

```java Java
LinkTokenExchange request = LinkTokenExchange
     .builder()
     .userId("<user_id>")
     .build();

var tokenResponse = vital.link().token(request);
```

```go Go
request := &vital.LinkTokenExchange{
     UserId:   "<user_id>",
}

tokenResponse, err := client.Link.Token(context.TODO(), request)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n", response)
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Libre is an [email](/api-reference/link/link-email-provider) provider.
   This means that when connecting a user we have to use
   the connect email provider method, passing in the email of the user's Libre account and region in short form.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
linkResponse = client.link.connect_email_auth_provider(
  provider="freestyle_libre",
  email="<email>",
  vital_link_token=token_response.link_token
)
```

```javascript Node
const linkRequest: EmailProviderAuthLink = {
    vitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.linkToken,
    email: "<email>"
}

const connectEmailResponse = await client.link.connectEmailAuthProvider(
    "freestyle_libre",
    linkRequest
)
```

```java Java
EmailProviderAuthLink request = EmailProviderAuthLink
        .builder()
        .vitalLinkToken(tokenResponse.getLinkToken())
        .email("<email>")
        .build();

var data = vital.link().connectEmailAuthProvider("<provider", request);
```

```go Go
emailAuthRequest := &vital.EmailProviderAuthLink{
  VitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.LinkToken,
  Email:          "<email>",
}

emailAuth, err := client.Link.ConnectEmailAuthProvider(context.TODO(), "freestyle_libre", emailAuthRequest)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n", emailAuth)
```

</CodeGroup>

Once this is complete we will start syncing data from their [Libre account](/api-details/data_flow).
