## Connecting Dexcom to Vital

You can connect your dexcom device to vital through Vital Link Widget or programatically like any 
other [OAuth](/api-reference/link/link-oauth-provider) provider.
We recommend you obtain custom OAuth credentials from [Dexcom](https://developer.dexcom.com) with production access and follow the guide
for [setting up custom credentials](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring_your_own_oauth) to get started.

## Webhooks

On successful connection, you will receive a [Connection create](/event-catalog/provider.connection.created) webhook, 
and subsequently, [Daily](/event-catalog/daily.data.glucose.created) and [Historical](/event-catalog/historical.data.glucose.created) Glucose webhooks.

The histrical webhook informs you that the last **30 days** of data prior to connection is available and the daily webhooks follow the usual semantics
for all vital daily webhooks.
