## Overview

Vital supports two ways to connect to LibreView for Abbott CGMs:

| Provider Slug      | Remarks                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | 
| `abbott_libreview` | Connect via LibreView patient account in any region. | 
| `freestyle_libre`  | Connect via regional LibreView practices (Vital-managed, or custom practices). |

### `freestyle_libre` for practice-based connections

With the `freestyle_libre` integration, users have to share/connect their LibreView patient account
with either Vital's LibreView practice, or a custom practice of yours.

Vital accesses the patient CGM data as a member of the LibreView practice.

### `abbott_libreview` for patient-based connections

With the `abbott_libreview` integration, users can connect their Abbott CGM devices simply by signing in
with their LibreView patient account. Vital accesses the patient CGM data as their personal account.

* You would not need to maintain any LibreView practices.
* You would not need to instruct your users to connect their account to a LibreView practice, before they can attempt to connect via Junction Link. 


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prepare for regular disconnection with `abbott_libreview`

Patient-based connections through `abbott_libreview` may **disconnect** at least once a year due to password rotation enforcement.

You can observe the error state through:

1. the [Provider Connection Error](/event-catalog/provider.connection.error) event; and
2. the [Get User Connections endpoint](/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers).

The following error types are relevant in this password rotation situation:

| Error Type | Remarks |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `provider_credential_error` | The patient has changed their password. They need to re-connect with the new password via Junction Link. |
| `provider_password_expired` | Login is blocked due to password expiration. Once the patient has changed their password, they need to re-connect with the new password via Junction Link.  |

When you detect a disconnection, guide your user to:

1. Sign into the LibreLink app or the LibreView web portal.
2. Update their account passwords.
3. Use the Junction Link Widget or your custom widget to re-establish the `abbott_libreview` connection.


## LibreView data use floating time basis

All LibreView (Freestyle Libre) data are in **floating time basis**.

Please go through the [Timestamps and Time Zones](/wearables/providers/timestamps-and-time-zones) guide to understand the
implications, as well as how to properly handle floating time data.


## Libre Notes Timeseries

LibreView, in addition to standard CGM data, provides insights manually added by the user.
This data is available in the following types:

* `note`: A general note added by the user, often providing context for other entries.
* `carbohydrates`: Grams of carbohydrates logged by the user.
* `insulin_injection`: Units of insulin injected by the user, categorized as either `rapid_acting` or `long_acting`.

<Info>
  Timestamps for these events have hourly granularity and are marked with the beginning of the hour.

## Connecting a LibreView patient account (`abbott_libreview`)

### Junction Link Widget

Abbott LibreView is automatically available as an option in the [Junction Link Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/launching_link).

### Junction Link API (custom widget)

If you intend to build a [custom widget on top of the Junction Link API](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget), Abbott LibreView is
exposed as a **password provider**:

<Steps>
  <Step number="1" title="Generate a Link Token">
  Start the linking process by [generating a short-lived Link Token](/api-reference/link/generate-link-token).
  </Step>

  <Step number="2" title="Submit username and password">
  Submit the username and password of the LibreView patient account to the [Link Password Provider](/api-reference/link/link-password-provider) endpoint.

  <Note>
  You need not specify any region in your request. Vital will match the correct LibreView region transparently.
  </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step number="3" title="Handle the multi-factor authentication request">
  The [Link Password Provider](/api-reference/link/link-password-provider) endpoint responds with `state: "pending_provider_mfa"`,
  alongside the MFA method being used, as well as a MFA hint.

  This means the user must complete multi-factor authentication before Vital can establish the connection. You should prompt the user
  to input the verification code they received out-of-band.
  </Step>

  <Step number="4" title="Submit the MFA Code">
  Submit the MFA code to the [Complete Password Provider MFA](/api-reference/link/complete-password-provider-mfa) endpoint.

  <Note>You must use the same Link Token you generated in Step 1.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step number="5" title="Linking completed">
  The linking process is completed. Historical pulls are scheduled to start as soon as possible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up practice-based connections (`freestyle_libre`)

### Adding users to a Practice

When integrating with Vital, you have two options: use Vital's practice, or yours. We call the latter a custom practice. Depending on the approach, you need to instruct your user's to connect their Libre account to a practice.

This allows Vital to start pulling data from their account. This is done through the Libre app:

### Bring Your Own Practice

<Info>
`freestyle_libre` custom practice connections is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

<Steps>

<Step title="Obtain the Vital practice email address">
Get in touch with [Vital Support](/home/getting-support) to request the region-specific Vital practice email address.
</Step>

<Step title="Invite the Vital practice">
Invite the Vital practice email address to join your LibreView practice as a **Care Team Admin**.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm with Vital support">
Inform Vital support of the invitation, and wait for the support acknowledgement of successful practice connection.
</Step>

</Steps>

Once the connection is established, Junction Link would recognize all patient emails having connected to your LibreView practice.
These patients do not need to connect separately to the [Vital practices](#using-vital-practices).

### Using Vital Practices

<Info>
  You can use a Vital practice to test the integration with Freestyle Libre.
  This modality is available to all subscriptions.
</Info>

Vital has two LibreView Practices that are available in all supported regions:

| Environment | Practice Name    |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Sandbox     | tryVital-sandbox |
| Production  | tryVital         |

You need to ask your user to add one of the above practices in their Libre App. Once that's done, data will start flowing.

### Junction Link Widget

To connect your user to Vital via the Link Widget you can follow the guide [here](/wearables/connecting-providers/launching_link).

<img src="/img/libre_connect.png" className="w-2/5 block mx-auto" />

### Junction Link API (custom widget)

1. To connect to Freestyle Libre, you must create a Junction Link token.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
token_response = client.link.token(user_id="<user_id>")
```

```javascript Node
const request: LinkTokenExchange = {
    userId: "<user_id>
}
const data = await client.link.token(request)
```

```java Java
LinkTokenExchange request = LinkTokenExchange
     .builder()
     .userId("<user_id>")
     .build();

var tokenResponse = vital.link().token(request);
```

```go Go
request := &vital.LinkTokenExchange{
     UserId:   "<user_id>
}

tokenResponse, err := client.Link.Token(context.TODO(), request)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n response)
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Libre is an [email](/api-reference/link/link-email-provider) provider.
   This means that when connecting a user we have to use
   the connect email provider method, passing in the email of the user's Libre account and region in short form.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
linkResponse = client.link.connect_email_auth_provider(
  provider="freestyle_libre
  email="<email>
  vital_link_token=token_response.link_token
)
```

```javascript Node
const linkRequest: EmailProviderAuthLink = {
    vitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.linkToken,
    email: "<email>"
}

const connectEmailResponse = await client.link.connectEmailAuthProvider(
    "freestyle_libre
    linkRequest
)
```

```java Java
EmailProviderAuthLink request = EmailProviderAuthLink
        .builder()
        .vitalLinkToken(tokenResponse.getLinkToken())
        .email("<email>")
        .build();

var data = vital.link().connectEmailAuthProvider("<provider request);
```

```go Go
emailAuthRequest := &vital.EmailProviderAuthLink{
  VitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.LinkToken,
  Email:          "<email>
}

emailAuth, err := client.Link.ConnectEmailAuthProvider(context.TODO(), "freestyle_libre emailAuthRequest)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n emailAuth)
```

</CodeGroup>

Once this is complete we will start syncing data from their [Libre account](/api-details/data_flow).
