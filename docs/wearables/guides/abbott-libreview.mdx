## Overview

Vital supports two ways to connect to LibreView for Abbott CGMs:

| Provider Slug      | Remarks                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | 
| `abbott_libreview` | Connect via LibreView patient account | 
| `freestyle_libre`  | Connect via Vital's LibreView practice, or your own custom practice. |

### `freestyle_libre` for practice-based connections

With the `freestyle_libre` integration, users have to share/connect their LibreView patient account
with either Vital's LibreView practice, or a custom practice of yours.

Vital accesses the patient CGM data as a member of the LibreView practice.

### `abbott_libreview` for patient-based connections

With the `abbott_libreview` integration, users can connect their CGM devices simply by signing in with their LibreView patient account.
Vital accesses the patient CGM data as their personal account.

* You would not need to maintain a LibreView practice.
* You would not need to instruct your users to share/connect to your practice, before they attempt to connect via Vital Link. 

## LibreView data use floating time basis

All LibreView (Freestyle Libre) data are in **floating time basis**.

Please go through the [Timestamps and Time Zones](/wearables/providers/timestamps-and-time-zones) guide to understand the
implications, as well as how to properly handle floating time data.

## Connecting a LibreView patient account (`abbott_libreview`)

### Vital Link Widget

Abbott LibreView is automatically available as an option in the [Vital Link Widget](/wearables/connecting-providers/launching_link).

### Vital Link API (custom widget)

If you intend to build a [custom widget on top of the Vital Link API](/wearables/connecting-providers/custom_widget), Abbott LibreView is
exposed as a **password provider**:

<Steps>
  <Step number="1" title="Generate a Link Token">
  Start the linking process by [generating a short-lived Link Token](/api-reference/link/generate-link-token).
  </Step>

  <Step number="2" title="Submit username, password and region">
  Submit the username, password and region of the LibreView patient account to the [Link Password Provider](/api-reference/link/link-password-provider) endpoint.

  <Note>
  You must specify the [LibreView region](#supported-libreview-regions).
  The region must align with the region in which the patient account is registered in.

  For example, for a patient account registered in Netherlands:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "patient@example.com",
    "password": "pAssW0rD",
    "region": "nl"
  }
  ```
  </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step number="3" title="Handle the multi-factor authentication request">
  The [Link Password Provider](/api-reference/link/link-password-provider) endpoint responds with `state: "pending_provider_mfa"`,
  alongside the MFA method being used, as well as a MFA hint.

  This means the user must complete multi-factor authentication before Vital can establish the connection. You should prompt the user
  to input the verification code they received out-of-band.
  </Step>

  <Step number="4" title="Submit the MFA Code">
  Submit the MFA code to the [Complete Password Provider MFA](/api-reference/link/complete-password-provider-mfa) endpoint.

  <Note>You must use the same Link Token you generated in Step 1.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step number="5" title="Linking completed">
  The linking process is completed. Historical pulls are scheduled to start as soon as possible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up practice-based connections (`freestyle_libre`)

### Adding users to a Practice

When integrating with Vital, you have two options: use Vital's practice, or yours. We call the latter a custom practice. Depending on the approach, you need to instruct your user's to connect their Libre account to a practice.

This allows Vital to start pulling data from their account. This is done through the Libre app:

#### Custom Practice

<Info>
`freestyle_libre` custom practice connections is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

<Info>
Please make sure you invite Vital to your practice as a clinician with admin rights. To connect a user to Vital you must first connect your Freestyle practice to Vital in the appropriate Vital region for your Freestyle account.

If you get stuck at any point join our Slack channel or send us a message to support@tryvital.io

</Info>

Freestyle Libre is available in different regions, ensure you invite the correct email as an admin of your practice:

**Vital US Region**

| Freestyle Region                               | 
| ---------------------------------------------- | 
| United States (`us`) \*                        | 
| Canada (`ca`)                                  | 
| India (`in`)                                  | 
| _(\*) Default Freestyle region if unspecified_ |

**Vital EU Region**

| Freestyle Region                               | 
| ---------------------------------------------- | 
| Europe (`eu`) \*                               | 
| Singapore (`sg`)                               | 
| Australia (`au`)                               | 
| Germany (`de`)                                 | 
| Netherlands (`nl`)                             | 
| Brazil (`br`)                                  | 
| _(\*) Default Freestyle region if unspecified_ |

#### Vital Practices

<Info>
  You can use a Vital practices to test the integration with Freestyle Libre.
  This modality is available to all subscriptions.
</Info>

Vital has two practices (depending on environment) this applies to all regions:

| Environment | Practice Name    |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Sandbox     | tryVital-sandbox |
| Production  | tryVital         |

You need to ask your user to add one of the above practices in their Libre App. Once that's done, data will start flowing.

### Vital Link Widget

To connect your user to Vital via the Link Widget you can follow the guide [here](/wearables/connecting-providers/launching_link).

<img src="/img/libre_connect.png" className="w-2/5 block mx-auto" />

### Vital Link API (custom widget)

1. To connect to Freestyle Libre, you must create a Vital Link token.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
token_response = client.link.token(user_id="<user_id>")
```

```javascript Node
const request: LinkTokenExchange = {
    userId: "<user_id>",
}
const data = await client.link.token(request)
```

```java Java
LinkTokenExchange request = LinkTokenExchange
     .builder()
     .userId("<user_id>")
     .build();

var tokenResponse = vital.link().token(request);
```

```go Go
request := &vital.LinkTokenExchange{
     UserId:   "<user_id>",
}

tokenResponse, err := client.Link.Token(context.TODO(), request)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n", response)
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Libre is an [email](/api-reference/link/link-email-provider) provider.
   This means that when connecting a user we have to use
   the connect email provider method, passing in the email of the user's Libre account and region in short form.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
linkResponse = client.link.connect_email_auth_provider(
  provider="freestyle_libre",
  email="<email>",
  vital_link_token=token_response.link_token
)
```

```javascript Node
const linkRequest: EmailProviderAuthLink = {
    vitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.linkToken,
    email: "<email>"
}

const connectEmailResponse = await client.link.connectEmailAuthProvider(
    "freestyle_libre",
    linkRequest
)
```

```java Java
EmailProviderAuthLink request = EmailProviderAuthLink
        .builder()
        .vitalLinkToken(tokenResponse.getLinkToken())
        .email("<email>")
        .build();

var data = vital.link().connectEmailAuthProvider("<provider", request);
```

```go Go
emailAuthRequest := &vital.EmailProviderAuthLink{
  VitalLinkToken: tokenResponse.LinkToken,
  Email:          "<email>",
}

emailAuth, err := client.Link.ConnectEmailAuthProvider(context.TODO(), "freestyle_libre", emailAuthRequest)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n", emailAuth)
```

</CodeGroup>

Once this is complete we will start syncing data from their [Libre account](/api-details/data_flow).
