## Permissions with Omron

Omron's API does not provide information on what permissions users granted when connecting. Additionally it gives the same error for unauthorized resources and when a user uses one account in multiple environments, so we can't tell these apart.
Because of this, we only accept Omron connections with all permissions granted.
