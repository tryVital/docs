## Connecting WHOOP to Vital

WHOOP is a [BYOO](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring_your_own_oauth) only provider, so you will need your own app in [WHOOP's developer dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.WHOOP.com/).

Then, you can configure the WHOOP integration in the Junction Dashboard by navigating to the Config > Custom Credentials page and clicking "Setup" next to WHOOP V2.

## Limitations

WHOOP sets forth the following limitation:
>Apps can be used for development immediately with a limit of 10 WHOOP members. To launch your app to all WHOOP members, you must first submit your app for approval.

Learn more about app approval in the [WHOOP developer documentation](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/app-approval/). WHOOP reviews apps on a monthly cadence.
