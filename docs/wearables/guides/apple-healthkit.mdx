title: "Apple HealthKit"

Apple HealthKit is an SDK-based provider. Your iOS consumer app would embed the Vital Mobile SDKs on a supported
stack. Data are then pulled from the Apple HealthKit data store on the user's iOS device.

Refer to the [Mobile SDK Installation](/wearables/sdks/installation) and [Vital Health SDK](/wearables/sdks/vital-health) guides for SDK installation
instructions and general API usage. This guide contains information on the the behaviour and required configuration
specific to the Apple HealthKit integration.

## Sync Frequency

| App state  | Behaviour |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Foreground | Apple HealthKit delivers any buffered and new changes immediately. |
| Background | Hourly batch delivery of changes, subject to operating system throttling. |

While the SDK schedules hourly data sync with Apple HealthKit, iOS has full discretion to defer the scheduled time
based on factors like CPU usage, battery usage, connectivity, and Low Power Mode.

In other words, the Vital SDK — or any third-party HealthKit apps — cannot guarantee the sync to happen on a strict
schedule. The hourly schedule is advisory and non-binding from the persective of iOS. The actual delivery frequency
can therefore fluctuate from hourly, to once a day, or when certain opportunity arises (e.g., when Sleep Mode ends,
or when the phone starts charging).


## Background Delivery


The iOS SDK can support observing new HealthKit data even when your app is not actively being used by your app user.
This provides a more seamless experience, since the app user need not periodically open your app to sync data.

### 1. Setup app entitlements 

Enable the "HealthKit > Background Delivery" entitlement:

<img src="/img/iOS/health_kit_permission_background_delivery.png" />

Enable the "Background Modes > Background Processing entitlement:

<img src="/img/iOS/ios_background_processing.png" />

### 2. Update your Info.plist

In your "Info > Custom iOS Target Properties" section — also known as the `Info.plist` file — these entries should be
configured:

| Key   | Value  |
| ----- | ------ |
| Privacy - Health Share Usage Description<br />(`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`) | An explanation of your usage of the user's HealthKit data. |
| Permitted background task scheduler identifiers<br />(`BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers`) | Include `io.tryvital.VitalHealthKit.ProcessingTask` in the array, alongside any other BGTask identifiers of yours. |


If you request write permissions, you must also specify:

| Key   | Value  |
| ----- | ------ |
| Privacy - Health Update Usage Description<br />(`NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`) | An explanation of what user health data your app is writing to Apple HealthKit. |


### 3. Integrate with iOS system callbacks

You must call `VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()` during `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` of your UIKit `UIApplicationDelegate`.
This applies to all iOS integrations, be it Native, React Native or Flutter.

This ensures that Vital has the opportunity to register all handlers before the app "finished launching" as per Apple HealthKit's specific timing requirement.
Background delivery may be missed if this timing requirement is not satisfied.

<Warning>

As per the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614175-enablebackgrounddelivery):

> As soon as your app launches, HealthKit calls the update handler for any observer queries that match the newly saved data. If you plan on supporting background delivery, set up all your observer queries in your app delegate’s application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method. By setting up the queries in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`, you ensure that you’ve instantiated your queries, and they’re ready to use before HealthKit delivers the updates.

In other words, make sure `VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()` is called inside your UIKit App Delegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. 

For React Native and Flutter SDK consumers, this means you must configure this directly in native code (Swift / Objective-C). Typically, an App Delegate would have
been already created as part of your generated React Native or Flutter Xcode project.

</Warning>


Your `AppDelegate` should then look like this:

Swift / Flutter iOS:
```swift
import VitalHealthKit

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {

    VitalHealthKitClient.automaticConfiguration()
    /// your code

    return true
  }
}
```

Objective-C / React Native iOS:
```swift
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "VitalHealthKitConfiguration.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  [VitalHealthKitConfiguration automaticConfiguration];
  /// your code

  return YES;
}
```

### 3. Epilogue

You are all set!

Note that there is no need to call `syncData()` manually at all. Once you have asked the user for permission on 
resources, sync would automatically starts every app launch, as well as whenever your app is woken up by Apple HealthKit to
respond to newly available data.

<Note>

As per the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614175-enablebackgrounddelivery):

> HealthKit wakes your app whenever a process saves or deletes samples of the specified type. The system wakes your app at most once per time period defined by the specified frequency. Some sample types have a maximum frequency of `HKUpdateFrequency.hourly`. The system enforces this frequency transparently.
>
> For example, on iOS, `stepCount` samples have an hourly maximum frequency.

This means that although we have background delivery's frequency set to `.hourly`, we cannot guarantee hourly syncing on the dot.
