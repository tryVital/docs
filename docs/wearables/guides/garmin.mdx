## Webhooks & Events

Garmin connections have a non-standard [webhook lifecycle](/webhooks/introduction):

<Steps>
<Step title="The Connection Created stage">
You will receive a [Provider Connection Created event](/webhooks/introduction#connection-created-stage) normally.
</Step>

<Step title="The Historical Data Backfill stage">
You would receive a [Historical Pull Completion event](/webhooks/introduction#historical-data-backfill-stage) **immediately** after the connection creation.
However, if you query Junction API immediately, you would observe **no historical data**.

<Warning>
The Historical Pull Completion event for Garmin connections does not indicate availability of historical data through the Junction API.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="The Incremental Data stage">
All **historical and new data** are delivered incrementally as [Data Events](/webhooks/introduction#incremental-data-stage) (`daily.data.*.*`).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This behaviour is exclusive to Garmin, as a downstream effect of Garmin's unique historical data access mechanism for third-party integrations.
</Note>

## Re-running the historical data backfill stage

Normally, when a user with an existing connection re-authenticates with the provider through [Junction Link](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/connecting-providers/introduction), Vital re-runs
the [Historical Data Backfill stage](/webhooks/introduction#historical-data-backfill-stage) automatically.

However, this **does not apply to Garmin** connections â€” you must first [deregister](/api-reference/user/deregister-a-provider) said users' existing Garmin connection for the re-run to take effect.

This behaviour is exclusive to Garmin, as a downstream effect of Garmin's unique historical data access mechanism for third-party integrations.
