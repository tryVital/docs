<Warning>
Vital Link API covers **only** [cloud-based providers](/wearables/providers/introduction#cloud-based-providers).

Your mobile app has to manage connections with SDK-based providers — such as Apple HealthKit and Android Health
Connect — through the [Vital Mobile Health SDK](/wearables/sdks/vital-health), separately from Vital Link.
</Warning>
