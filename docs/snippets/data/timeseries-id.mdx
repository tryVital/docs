Each timeseries sample is uniquely identified by a compound key of:

- the timeseries resource type;
- the source provider;
- the [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type); and
- the sample timestamp.

Given the same compound key, the latest value of a sample you received **replaces** all the previous values.
