Privacy is at the heart of everything we do at Junction. We are committed to protecting your privacy and your data and have built our service with those values in mind.

To do this we've taken a number of precautions:

1. Users can deregister their devices and delete their data from Junction.
2. We encrypt all data at REST and in transit. Furthermore, we encrypt the data prior to storing it in our database. To do this we use **[Evervault](https://evervault.com)**.

## How this works?

### Storing Data

When we pull data from various wearable provider's this data goes through the Evervault encryption proxy - which encrypts the data before we store it.

### Retrieving Data

When you request data from the Junction API, it is decrypted via the Evervault encryption proxy before being returned.
