### A Junction API endpoint

If your system has distributed tracing configured that are compliant with W3C Trace Context  (e.g., OpenTelemetry tracing),
you can provide us the Trace ID of the operation **in your system**.

A Trace ID looks like this: `0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c`.

This helps us locate the concerned API request and related contexts.

<Note>
This works only if your distributed tracing setup would propagate Trace Context to your outbound HTTP requests â€” more
specifically injecting the standards-based `traceparent` header into the requests.

### A wearables provider connection

Before reporting an issue, we encourage you to try out the following steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Check the resource availability" icon="circle-question">
    The [Get User Connections](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint
    reports the resource availability of all the connections. More specifically, it tells you:

    1. What resources are available for a given user connection
    2. Why each individual resource is available or unavailable, in terms of provider API access scopes.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Issues with historical pulls?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    If you are having issues with historical data specifically, the [Historical Pull Introspection](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint
    provides a track record of historical pulls of all your user connections.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Issues with data availability?" icon="sparkles">
    If you have troubles with data availability in general, the [User Resource Introspection](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint
    is a live data ingestion record of all your user connections.
    
    <Note>
    This is inclusive of all historical data covered by the
    Historical Pull Introspection endpoint.
    </Note>
    </Step>
