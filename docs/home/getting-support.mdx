### Issues with Vital API

When you encounter an unexpected response from the Vital API, please provide
the `traceparent` header value from the HTTP response you received if possible. This
helps us narrow down the context surrounding your issue.

A `traceparent` response header looks like this:

```
traceparent: 00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01
```

It contains a trace ID that links back to the original API request:

* If you make the API request without a `traceparent` header, Vital's infrastructure
  assigns a unique trace ID to it on entry.

* If your API request is instrumented using OpenTelemetry, W3C Trace Context or other
  interoperable tools, these tools would inject a `traceparent` header automatically.
  Vital's infrastructure would adopt the trace ID from your API request.
