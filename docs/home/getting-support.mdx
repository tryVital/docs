### A Junction API endpoint

When you encounter an unexpected response from the Junction API, please provide
the `traceparent` header value from the HTTP response you received if possible. This
helps us narrow down the context surrounding your issue.

A `traceparent` response header looks like this:

```
traceparent: 00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01
```

It contains a trace ID that links back to the original API request:

* If you make the API request without a `traceparent` header, Vital's infrastructure
  assigns a unique trace ID to it on entry.

* If your API request is instrumented using OpenTelemetry, W3C Trace Context or other
  interoperable tools, these tools would inject a `traceparent` header automatically.
  Vital's infrastructure would adopt the trace ID from your API request.


### A wearables provider connection

Before reporting an issue, we encourage you to try out the following steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Check the resource availability" icon="circle-question">
    The [Get User Connections](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/user/get-users-connected-providers) endpoint
    reports the resource availability of all the connections. More specifically, it tells you:

    1. What resources are available for a given user connection
    2. Why each individual resource is available or unavailable, in terms of provider API access scopes.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Issues with historical pulls?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    If you are having issues with historical data specifically, the [Historical Pull Introspection](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint
    provides a track record of historical pulls of all your user connections.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Issues with data availability?" icon="sparkles">
    If you have troubles with data availability in general, the [User Resource Introspection](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint
    is a live data ingestion record of all your user connections.
    
    <Note>
    This is inclusive of all historical data covered by the
    Historical Pull Introspection endpoint.
    </Note>
    </Step>

Vital support for further assistance.
