Communication for patients is done via email or SMS, for Walk-in orders.
Customers have the following options when setting this up:

- `Default` - Email and SMS communications are enabled.
- `SMS Only or Email Only` - Only SMS or Email communication is enabled.
- `Disable` - All communications from Vital are disabled.

Each option has a different set of content and status changes, depending on what triggered them.

<Info>You can enable or disable SMS and Email communications individually through the [**Vital Dashboard**](http://app.tryvital.io/), under the Team Settings section.</Info>
