Communication for patients is done via email or SMS, for Walk-in orders.
Customers have the following options when setting this up:

- `Default` - Email and SMS communications are enabled.
- `SMS Only or Email Only` - Only SMS or Email communication is enabled.
- `Disable` - All communications from Vital are disabled.

Each option has a different set of content and status changes, depending on what triggered them.

## Scheduling Appointments Before A Requisition Has Been Created

<FeatureBeta />

If the ability to [`schedule appointments before a requisition has been created`](/lab/walk-in/order-lifecycle#scheduling-appointments-before-a-requisition-has-been-created) is enabled for your team, all appointment-related messages
will be triggered by the **appointment** status, not the **order** status. All non appointment-related messages will be triggered by the **order** status e.g.
`requisition_created`, `completed` etc. (see above section).

### SMS Messages

A table of the **Appointment Status** and **default SMS** is provided below:

| Appointment Status | Default Message |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | _``"Your appointment with the lab has been booked at {date} over at {address}! Here's your appointment key: {appointment_key}"``_ <Note>   This message is sent only for Quest orders and Quest appointments placed through Vital API."``_ </Note> |
| `cancelled` | _``"Hey, your lab appointment at {date} for {team_name} has been cancelled."``_ <Note>   This message is sent only for Quest orders and Quest appointments placed through Vital API. </Note> |

### Emails

No emails are sent for this feature.


## Disable Communications
