The following webhook events are of interest, when placing a Walk-in order. Those are
described in detail in the following sections.

## Order webhook events

Based on the status present in [`Order Lifecycle`](/lab/walk-in/order-lifecycle),
Vital will trigger two kinds of webhook events, [`labtest.order.created`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.created) and
[`labtest.order.updated`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.updated).

The `labtest.order.created` event is triggered when an order is created in the system,
having the `ordered` status, and all subsequent status changes will trigger a `labtest.order.updated` event in the system.

<Note>The `partial_results` status does not trigger a Webhook unless specifically requested from Vital.</Note>

The webhook payload body will have the following information if the Order is in the `completed` status:

## Appointment webhook events

Based on the status present in [`Order and Appointment Lifecycle - Appointment Lifecycle`](/lab/walk-in/order-lifecycle#appointment-lifecycle),
Vital will trigger the [`labtest.appointment.updated`](/event-catalog/labtest.appointment.updated) webhook event.

<Info>
    If the ability to [schedule appointments before a requisition has been created](/lab/walk-in/order-lifecycle#scheduling-appointments-before-a-requisition-has-been-created) is enabled for your team, and you intend to send patient communications for appointment updates, use the `labtest.appointment.updated` event. See more on communications for this feature [here](/lab/walk-in/communications#scheduling-appointments-before-a-requisition-has-been-created).
</Info>

The webhook payload body may have the following information if the appointment is in the `scheduled` status, after a **reschedule** has happened:
