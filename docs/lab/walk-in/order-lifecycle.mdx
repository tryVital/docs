The **Walk-In Phlebotomy** orders are composed of two different lifecycles, the **Order** lifecycle and
the **appointment** lifecycle, detailed in the following sections.

## Order Lifecycle

As discussed in [`Lab Test Lifecycle - Statuses`](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#statuses),
each lab testing modality has the following format

```[HIGH-LEVEL STATUS].[TEST MODALITY].[LOW-LEVEL STATUS]```

For each modality, there can be multiple **low-level status**, for **Walk-In Phlebotomy** the
possible low-level status are:

- `ordered`: Vital received the order, stored it into our system, and started processing it asynchronously.
- `requisition_created`: An order requisition form was validated and created with the partner laboratory, making the order available to be carried out.
- `requisition_bypassed`: An order requisition form wasn't created when the order was placed with us because it already existed.
- `appointment_pending`: An appointment was placed in Vital's system for the order, but doesn't have a scheduled date.
- `appointment_scheduled`: An appointment was scheduled or rescheduled for the order.
- `appointment_cancelled`: The appointment was cancelled, by either the patient, Vital or you.
- `partial_results`: The laboratory has started making partial results available.
- `redraw_available`: The result has been marked as final but is missing biomarker results due to lab error. (Currently in beta testing.)
- `completed`: The laboratory processed the blood sample and final results are available.
- `cancelled`: The order was cancelled by either the patient, Vital or you.

The Finite State Machine that defines the possible transitions for the low-level statuses described above is illustrated
in the following diagram.

<Info>In **sandbox**, there is no async transition from the `ordered` state to the `requisition_created` state, this must be **manually triggered** via the **Vital Dashboard**.</Info>

## Appointment Lifecycle

The appointment lifecycle is separate from the order lifecyle, and it corresponds to a single appointment.
The possible status are defined as follows:

- `pending`: An appointment was placed in the system, and is pending updates from the phlebotomy service.
- `scheduled`: An appointment was scheduled or rescheduled.

The Finite State Machine that defines the possible transitions for the appointment statuses described above is illustrated
in the following diagram.

</Frame>

The events are related to a single appointment. An order can have multiple existing appointments in Vital system, although only one appointment will be considered active
and returned when using the [GET Appointment endpoint](/api-reference/lab-testing/psc-schedulling/get-psc-appointment).


## Scheduling Appointments Before A Requisition Has Been Created

<FeatureBeta />

When this feature is enabled on your Team, you can create an Patient Service Center (PSC) appointment even before the requisition has been created for
the corresponding Order (i.e., reaching the `requisition_created` status).

This allows you to build an experience that can order the lab test _and_ book an appointment consecutively, without having to wait on the
asynchronous requisition creation process that may take an indeterminate amount of time.

### API Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating an appointment">
  You create an Appointment for an Order which does not yet have a requisition.

  The Appointment starts with the `reserved` status.

  <Note>
  If the order requisition has been created on or before the time slot confirmation, the Appointment moves directly to the
  `confirmed` status. The `reserved` status would be skipped.
  </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Waiting for Requisition Creation">
  The requisition is being created asynchronously.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Requisition has been created">
  The requisition has now been created.

  For all PSC Appointments:

  1. The Order would move through the `requisition_created`, `appointment_pending` and `appointment_scheduled` Order statuses in quick succession.
  2. The Appointment would move to the `confirmed` status automatically, which corresponds to the `scheduled` appointment event.

  You would receive three `labtest.order.updated` events, one each for the three Order status transition. You will also received
  a `labtest.appointment.updated` event for the Appointment status transition.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Cancelling an appointment

If an Appointment is cancelled **before** a requisition has been created:

* The Appointment would move to the `cancelled` status; and
* There is no change to the Order, which would remain in the `ordered` status.

If an Appointment is cancelled **after** a requisition has been created:

1. The Appointment would move to the `cancelled` status; and
2. The Order would move from the `appointment_pending` or `appointment_scheduled` status to the `appointment_cancelled` status.
