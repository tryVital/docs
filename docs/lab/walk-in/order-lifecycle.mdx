title: "Order Lifecycle"
---

As discussed in [`Lab Test Lifecycle - Statuses`](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#statuses),
each lab testing modality has the following format

```[HIGH-LEVEL STATUS].[TEST MODALITY].[LOW-LEVEL STATUS]```

For each modality, there can be multiple **low-level status**, for **Walk-in** orders the
possible low-level status are:

- `ordered`: Vital received the order, stored it into our system, and started processing it asynchronously.
- `requisition_created`: An order requisition form was validated and created with the partner laboratory, making the order available to be carried out.
- `partial_results`: The laboratory has made partial results available.
- `completed`: The laboratory processed the blood sample and final results are available.
- `cancelled`: The order was cancelled by either the patient, Vital or you.

The Finite State Machine that defines the possible transitions for the low-level statuses described above is illustrated
in the following diagram.

<Info>In **sandbox**, there is no async transition from the `ordered` state to the `requisition_created` state, this must be **manually triggered** via the **Vital Dashboard**.</Info>
