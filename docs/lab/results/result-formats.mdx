title: "Result Formats"
---

Vital's API returns results in two different formats.

- `PDF`
- `JSON`

## PDF Results

We return the raw results in PDF form, that we receive directly from our partner labs. This can be retrieved as follows:

```bash Get order results PDF
curl --request GET \
     --url {{BASE_URL}}/v3/order/result/pdf \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
     --header 'x-vital-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
```

An example result:

<img src="/img/test_result.jpg" className="w-2/3 h-2/3" />

## JSON Results

We also return the parsed results in JSON format, so you can use them to generate your own forms.

These results are returned in a structured format, which you can find [here](/api-reference/results/get-results).

<Warning>The `results` field, according to the spec, can return either a `list[BiomarkerResult]` or an untyped `dict`. This is due to backwards compatibility, and you can disregard the untyped `dict`</Warning>

### Result Status

The `status` field can be one of the following:

1. `ResultStatus.PARTIAL` - The results are partial.
    Labs can return results before all biomarkers are available.
    Vital makes these results available to you as soon as we receive them, but does not send a webhook notification for `partial` results.

    This means that if you probe the API for results, you might get a `partial` result, even if there was no webhook for a `labtest.update` event.

    This is done due to the possibility of [critical values](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#critical-results) in the results.

2. `ResultStatus.FINAL` - The results are complete.
    This means that all biomarkers are available, and the results are final. You will receive a `labtest.update` webhook notification for this event.

### BiomarkerResult

A `BiomarkerResult` has the following definition:

```python
name: str
slug: str
value: float  # deprecated
result: str
type: ResultType
unit: str | None
timestamp: datetime | None
notes: str | None
min_range_value: float | None
max_range_value: float | None
is_above_max_range: bool | None
is_below_min_range: bool | None
interpretation: str = Interpretation.NORMAL
loinc: str | None
loinc_slug: str | None
```

#### ResultType

Results can fall into one of the following categories:

1. `ResultType.NUMERIC` - A numeric result, e.g. `1.2`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the number, and the `value` field will be a float representation of the number.

2. `ResultType.RANGE` - A range result, e.g. `<1.2`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the range value, and the `value` field will be `-1`.

    Note that you will also find the `<1.2` value in the `notes` field.

    A range result will always be a value following the pattern `[<>]=?\d+(\.\d+)?`.


3. `ResultType.COMMENT` - A text result, e.g. `Positive`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the text, and the `value` field will be `-1`.

    Note that you will also find the `Positive` value in the `notes` field.

<Warning>The `value` field in deprecated and will eventually be removed.</Warning>

#### Interpretation

Interpretation is a string value that can be one of the following:

1. `Interpretation.NORMAL` - The result is within normal parameters.
2. `Interpretation.ABNORMAL` - The result is outside of normal parameters.
3. `Interpretation.CRITICAL` - The result is outside of critical parameters.
    In this case, refer to the [critical values](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#critical-results) section.

#### Standardisation - LOINC

It's possible to test the same biomarkers across different laboratories. For these to match, we use the [LOINC](https://loinc.org/) standard.

In the `BiomarkerResult` object, you can see two fields `loinc_slug` and `loinc`. These fields refer to the LOINC standard. Customers should use this standard, so it's possible to match results across different laboratories.
You can expect that the `slug` field is what the laboratory returns to us - and the `loinc_slug` is the standardised version.

An example:

| Lab | Slug | LOINC | LOINC Slug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Labcorp | hdl-cholesterol | 2085-9 | cholesterol-in-hdl-mass-vol |
| USSL | hdl | 2085-9 | cholesterol-in-hdl-mass-vol |

As you can see, the same biomarker `HDL Cholesterol` can have different slugs across different laboratories. However it's represented by the same LOINC value.


#### Expected Results

When ordering a `lab_test`, you can see which `markers` each test orders. These can either be `panels` composed of multiple `biomarkers` or just individual `biomarkers`.

This means that a `lab_test` with only one associated `marker`, such as `Lipid Panel`, can return multiple `result markers`. We call these expected results.
Each `marker` can thus be composed of multiple `expected results` which match to a `loinc`.

As an example, here's the expected results for the `Lipid Panel` marker:

```json
"expected_results":[
   {
      "id":1108,
      "name":"VLDL Cholesterol Cal",
      "slug":"vldl-cholesterol-cal",
      "lab_id":6,
      "provider_id":"011919",
      "loinc":{
         "id":5062,
         "name":"Cholesterol in VLDL Calc [Mass/Vol]",
         "slug":"cholesterol-in-vldl-calc-mass-vol",
         "code":"13458-5",
         "unit":"mg/dL"
      }
   },
   {
      "id":1109,
      "name":"Cholesterol, Total",
      "slug":"cholesterol-total",

         "slug":"cholesterol-mass-vol",
         "code":"2093-3",
         "unit":"mg/dL"
      }
   },
   {
      "id":1110,
      "name":"HDL Cholesterol",
      "slug":"hdl-cholesterol",
      "lab_id":6,
      "provider_id":"011817",
      "loinc":{
         "id":11858,
         "name":"Cholesterol in HDL [Mass/Vol]",
         "slug":"cholesterol-in-hdl-mass-vol",
         "code":"2085-9",
         "unit":"mg/dL"
      }
   },
   {
      "id":1112,
      "name":"Triglycerides",
      "slug":"triglycerides",
      "lab_id":6,
      "provider_id":"001172",
      "loinc":{
         "id":16384,
         "name":"Triglyceride [Mass/Vol]",
         "slug":"triglyceride-mass-vol",
         "code":"2571-8",
         "unit":"mg/dL"
      }
   },
   {
      "id":1113,
      "name":"LDL Chol Calc (NIH)",
      "slug":"ldl-chol-calc-nih",
      "lab_id":6,
      "provider_id":"012059",
      "loinc":{
         "id":5060,
         "name":"Cholesterol in LDL Calc [Mass/Vol]",
         "slug":"cholesterol-in-ldl-calc-mass-vol",
         "code":"13457-7",
         "unit":"mg/dL"
      }
   }
]
```

You can use this information to verify if the final results are composed of all expected results.

In order to obtain this data, you can use the following endpoints:

1. [GET /v3/lab_tests/markers](/api-reference/lab-testing/biomarkers)
    
    This allows you to search markers based on laboratory or name.

2. [GET /v3/lab_tests/\{id\}/markers](/api-reference/lab-testing/lab-test-markers)

    This allows you to see all markers associated with a lab test and it's expected results.
