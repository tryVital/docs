title: "Testing in Sandbox"
---

In order for Customers to be able to simulate the ordering process in the sandbox environment, Vital provides both simulated results and a way to transition an order through it's [lifecycle](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle).

## Creating Lab Tests

Every created team comes with 3 standard `Lab Tests` to allow the Customer to test all 3 modalities.

However, since most customers choose to have their own custom lab tests, you should create your own tests using the [API](/lab/workflow/create-test). This is encouraged, as Vital generates results based on the associated markers. More on this on the [results section](/lab/overview/sandbox#results).

## Lifecycle

When an order is placed in the sandbox environment, it is "stuck" in the `ordered` state and will not progress unless triggered to do so. This can be done through the dashboard, or through the [API](/api-reference/lab-testing/simulate-order).

Initiating the simulation process will progress the order through the expected success states defined in the [lifecycle section](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle), triggering all expected webhooks, emails and SMS's.

<Warning>
  When testing the At-Home Phlebotomy, there is only one specific address which is allowed, this address is `West Lincoln Street, Phoenix, AZ 85004, USA`.
</Warning>

## Results

In order to allow Customers to test, Vital generate's fake results for each lab test, based on the [expected markers](/lab/results/result-formats#expected-results).

The generated results will cycle through all possible [result types](/lab/results/result-formats#resulttype).

<Warning>
  Note that generated values might not match the expected unit.
</Warning>

As for the PDF results, these are not generated, and Vital returns an example PDF that does not reflect the ordered test.

## Customizing the Response

You can customize the end response of the results via the body of the [Simulate Order](https://docs.junction.com/api-reference/lab-testing/simulate-order) endpoint.

There are three avenues of customization currently:

1. Interpretation

   Supplying the `interpretation` field will set the status of the result to the supplied value. If you set it to critical, then the critical result workflow will be triggered.

```json
{
  "interpretation": "critical"
}
```

2. Result Types

This field controls what result types will be generated. Ommiting it will means the result will cycle through all of them.

```json
{
  "result_types": ["numeric", "comment"]
}
```

3. Missing Results

Supplying this field will generate missing biomarkers in the result.

```json
{
  "has_mising_results": true
}
```
