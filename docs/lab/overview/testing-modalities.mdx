title: "Testing Modalities"
---

By integrating with our API, you will have access to the following testing modalities:

- At-home test kit.
- At-home phlebotomy visit.
- Walk-in test visit.
- On-site colllection visit (in closed beta).

## At-home test kits

This involves sending a kit to a patient's home. They will then be able to collect their sample specimen and send it back to our lab networks via mail.

At home testing kits are comprised of a number of components such as:

- Mailer Box
- Blade Lancets
- Plasters
- Gauze
- ADX Card
- Blood collection card
- Saliva Tubes
- Collection Supplies
- Instruction Booklet

Additional components can be included in the test kit box. To fully customize the kit, just contact us [support@tryvital.io](mailto:support@tryvital.io).

## At-home phlebotomy

At-home phlebotomy requires a phlebotomist to visit a patient's home and carrying out the phlebotomy draw. The sample is then delivered to the lab by the phlebotomist.

The flow for at-home phlebotomy orders is as follows:

- [Place an order](/lab/overview/quickstart) via the API.
- The order is processed in the background. For at-home phlebotomy, this means generating the requisition form for the lab test.
- Once the requisition form is ready, a webhook update and an email to the patient are sent. The email will them know that they can now book an appointment.
- The patient goes through Vital's appointment booking dashboard, where they can select a location and time from the available slots.
- Once the appointment takes place and the sample is drawn, it will be taken to the lab.
- Once the lab analyzes the results, the order is complete and the results can be [fetched](/lab/results/result-formats).

## Walk-in tests

Walk-in tests require the patient to visit a lab location (often referred to as a Patient Service Center or PSC)—such as Quest, Labcorp, or BioReference—to have their sample collected. A requisition form is needed to perform the test, which Junction’s API generates if the patient meets the required conditions.

This workflow closely mirrors the at-home phlebotomy flow, except that appointment scheduling is not required. With a "walk-in" test, a patient can simply _walk in_ to a PSC or they can schedule an appointment (Quest only).

## On-site collection

On-site collection also require the patient to visit a Patient Service Center closely mirrors the walk-in test flow. Scheduling an appointment is not necessary. On-site collections are currently in beta testing.
