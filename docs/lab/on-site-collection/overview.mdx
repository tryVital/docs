<FeatureBeta />

On-site collections are one of our offered modalities. Their locations are customer-managed settings where blood draws occur outside of traditional lab-owned patient service centers â€” such as primary care clinics, employer health centers, or event-based wellness pop-ups.

## Ordering Flow overview

To achieve this, a high-level overview of the process is defined as:

- An order is placed in Junction's system through our Dashboard or API.
- The order is added to a background queue and additional checks are made before a test requisition is created with the chosen Laboratory.
- After the requisition is created, some form of communication is carried out with the patient.
- After that, the patient can go at any time they want to the draw location to have their blood drawn.
- The Laboratory processes the patient's blood sample and generates the required results.
- Junction exposes the results via API as soon as they are available, both on PDF and structured data via API.

To find out more details, see [`Order Lifecycle`](/lab/on-site-collection/order-lifecycle), [`Communications`](/lab/on-site-collection/communications) and [`Webhooks`](/lab/on-site-collection/webhooks).
