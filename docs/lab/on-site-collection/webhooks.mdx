The following webhook events are of interest, when placing an On-site collection. Those are
described in detail in the following sections.

## Order webhook events

Based on the status present in [`Order Lifecycle`](/lab/on-site-collection/order-lifecycle),
Junction will trigger two kinds of webhook events, [`labtest.order.created`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.created) and
[`labtest.order.updated`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.updated).

The `labtest.order.created` event is triggered when an order is created in the system,
having the `ordered` status, and all subsequent status changes will trigger a `labtest.order.updated` event in the system.

<Note>The `partial_results` status does not trigger a Webhook unless specifically requested from Junction.</Note>

The webhook payload body will have the following information if the Order is in the `completed` status:
