The **On-site Collection** orders are composed of one lifecycle, the **Order** lifecycle, detailed in the following section.

## Order Lifecycle

As discussed in [`Lab Test Lifecycle - Statuses`](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#statuses),
each lab testing modality has the following format

```[HIGH-LEVEL STATUS].[TEST MODALITY].[LOW-LEVEL STATUS]```

For each modality, there can be multiple **low-level status**, for **On-site Collection** the
possible low-level status are:

- `ordered`: Junction received the order, stored it into our system, and started processing it asynchronously.
- `requisition_created`: An order requisition form was validated and created with the partner laboratory, making the order available to be carried out.
- `requisition_bypassed`: An order requisition form wasn't created when the order was placed with us because it already existed.
- `draw_completed`: The phlebotomy was completed and the blood was drawn successfuly.
- `partial_results`: The laboratory has started making partial results available.
- `completed`: The laboratory processed the blood sample and final results are available.
- `cancelled`: The order was cancelled by either the patient, Junction or you.

This closely models that of walk-in tests. Refer to that [order lifecycle](/lab/walk-in/order-lifecycle#order-lifecycle) for a diagramatic explanation.
