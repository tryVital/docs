Communication for patients is done via SMS, for At-home Teskit orders.
Customers have the following options when setting this up:

- `Default` - SMS communications are enabled.
- `Disable` - All communications from Vital are disabled.

Each option has a different set of content and status changes, depending on what triggered them.

<Info>You can enable or disable SMS individually through the [**Junction Dashboard**](http://app.junction.com/), under the Team Settings section.</Info>

## Default Communications

### SMS Messages

A table of the **Order Status** and **default SMS** is provided bellow:

### Emails

We do not send emails for At-home Testkits.

## Disable Communications

In this case, no communications will be sent from Vital. You have the ability to produce completely customized communications
using the [`Webhook events`](/lab/testkits/webhooks) described previously.
