Communication for patients is done via email or SMS, for At-Home Phlebotomy orders.
Customers have the following options when setting this up:

- `Default` - Email and SMS communications are enabled.
- `SMS Only` - Only SMS communication is enabled.
- `Disable` - All communications from Vital are disabled.

Each option has a different set of content and status changes, depending on what triggered them.

<Info>You can enable or disable SMS and Email communications individually through the [**Vital Dashboard**](http://app.tryvital.io/), under the Team Settings section.</Info>

## Scheduling Appointments Before A Requisition Has Been Created

<FeatureBeta />

If the ability to [`schedule appointments before a requisition has been created`](/lab/at-home-phlebotomy/order-appointment-lifecycle#scheduling-appointments-before-a-requisition-has-been-created) is enabled for your team, all appointment-related messages
will be triggered by the **appointment** status, not the **order** status. All non appointment-related messages will be triggered by the **order** status e.g.
`requisition_created`, `draw_completed` etc. (see above section).

### SMS Messages

A table of the **Appointment Status** and **default SMS** is provided below:

| Appointment Status | Default Message |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | _"Your appointment with the phlebotomist has been booked at **date**! You can reschedule or cancel using the following link **booking_link**."_ |
| `cancelled` | _"Hey, your at-home-phlebotomy appointment at **date** for the **team_name** has been cancelled. You can rebook using the following link **booking_link**."_ |

### Emails

For emails, the following table describes what information each email contains for each Appointment Status:

| Appointment Status | Email Content Description |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | An email confirming the appointment date and time will be sent to the patient, with the possibility of rescheduling or cancelling the appointment. |
