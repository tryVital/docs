Communications with the patient are carried in two different ways for At-Home Phlebotomy orders, being them
email and SMS messages. There are three distinct communications options:

- `Default` - Email and SMS communications are enabled.
- `SMS Only` - Only SMS communication is enabled.
- `Disable` - All communications from Vital are disabled.

Each of these has a different set of content and status changes that trigger them, described in the following sections.

<Info>You can enable or disable SMS and Email communications individually through the **Vital Dashboard**, under the Team Settings section.</Info>

## Default Communications

as well as SMS messages.
