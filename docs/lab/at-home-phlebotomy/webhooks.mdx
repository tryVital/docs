The following webhook events are of interest, when placing an At-Home Phlebotomy order. Those are
described in detail in the following sections.

## Order webhook events

Based on the status present in [`Order and Appointment Lifecycle - Order Lifecycle`](/lab/at-home-phlebotomy/order-appointment-lifecycle#order-lifecycle),
Vital will trigger two kinds of webhook events, [`labtest.order.created`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.created) and
[`labtest.order.updated`](/event-catalog/labtest.order.updated).

The `labtest.order.created` event is triggered when an order is created in the system,
having the `ordered` status, and all subsequent status changes will trigger a `labtest.order.updated` event in the system.

<Note>The `partial_results` status does not trigger a Webhook currently.</Note>

The webhook payload body will have the following information if the Order is in the `appointment_scheduled` status:

```json Phlebotomy Order Updated

  ]
}
```

## Appointment webhook events

Based on the status present in [`Order and Appointment Lifecycle - Appointment Lifecycle`](/lab/at-home-phlebotomy/order-appointment-lifecycle#appointment-lifecycle),
Vital will trigger the [`labtest.appointment.updated`](/event-catalog/labtest.appointment.updated) webhook event.

<Info>
    The `labtest.appointment.updated` event is triggered for all possible appointment statuses, and is the **recommended** way of integrating to fetch all
    **At-Home Phlebotomy** status updates, together with the [Order Webhooks](#order-webhook-events).
</Info>

The webhook payload body may have the following information if the appointment is in the `scheduled` status, after a **reschedule** has happened:

```json Phlebotomy Appointment Updated
