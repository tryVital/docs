title: "Phlebotomy Service Tiers"
---

Vital offers multiple Tiers of phlebotomy services, with different coverage capabilities:

- **Appointment Ready:** An appointment is booked in Vital using the patient’s address and the  appointment’s date time. The scheduling is completely synchronous and fully controlled by Vital's customers through our API.
- **Appointment Request:** An appointment is requested through Vital system using the patient’s address. A phlebotomist will eventually assign themselves to the appointment and define the appointment’s date time with the patient.

The following Providers are available for each Tier:

|  | Getlabs | Phlebfinders (Beta) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Appointment Ready | X |  |
| Appointment Request |  | X |

<Info>`appointment-request` appointments will start in the `pending` status, and won't have any time or date information.</Info>

## High Level flow for Appointment Scheduling

<br />

The recommend high level flow for selecting an appointment at Vital is:

- Place an At-Home Phlebotomy order with the [`POST /v3/order`](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order) endpoint.
- Wait for the `Requisition Ready` status updates through our Webhooks.
- Fetch Provider data via the [`GET /v3/order/area/info`](/api-reference/lab-testing/area-info) endpoint, the response payload should look like this:

```json
{
  "zip_code": "85004",
  "phlebotomy": {
    "is_served": true,
		"providers": [
    {
      "name": "getlabs",
      "tier": ["appointment-ready"]
    },
    {
      "name": "phlebfinders",
      "tier": ["appointment-request"]
    }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Select the Provider that best fit your needs.
    - If you use the [`POST /v3/order/{order_id}/phlebotomy/appointment/book`](/api-reference/lab-testing-at-home-phlebotomy/appointment-booking) endpoint, an `appointment-ready` provider is chosen on your behalf.
    - if you use the [`POST /v3/order/{order_id}/phlebotomy/appointment/request`](/api-reference/lab-testing-at-home-phlebotomy/appointment-request) endpoint, you must select a provider that offers an `appointment-request` tier.
- Wait for the `Appointment Webhooks` and `Order Webhooks` described in the [Webhooks](/lab/at-home-phlebotomy/webhooks) section.
