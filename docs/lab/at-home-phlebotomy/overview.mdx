At-home phlebotomy tests are one of our offered modalities. This modality is focused on patients that don't
want to go to a Laboratory, but instead want a phlebotomist to come to their home or office to carry out the
phlebotomy draw. The phlebotomist is responsible for bringing the required equipement and tubes and then delivering those
to our partner Laboratories.

## Ordering Flow overview

To achieve this, a high-level overview of the process is defined as:

- An order is placed in Vital's system through our Dashboard or API.
- The order is added to a background queue and additional checks are made before a test requisition is created
with the chosen Laboratory.
- After the requistion is created, some form of communication is carried out with the patient so he can book an appointment with our
phlebotomy partners.
- At the day of the appointment, our partner phlebotomist will contact the patient directly to assert that everything
is correct for carrying out the appointment.
- The phlebotomis goes to the appointment, draws the patient blood and then delivers it to the Laboratory.
- The Laboratory process the patient blood sample and generate the required results.
- Vital exposes the results via API as soon as they are available, both on PDF and Strutctured data via API.


## Constraints

- Phlebotomy appointments are not supported for patients under 18 years of age.
- The same patient can't have more than one active appointment in a specific **Phlebotomy provider**.
- The addresses provided when fetching the appointment availability slots must be reachable by the phlebotomist, containing street number and unit (if exists).
