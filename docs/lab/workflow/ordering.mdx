# Concepts

Vital has a series of concepts to grasp regarding ordering: 

- [Lab Tests](/lab/workflow/create-test)
- [Lifecyle of an Order](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle)
- [AoE](/lab/workflow/aoe)
- [Registrable Kits](/lab/workflow/order-registrable-testkit)
- [Scheduled Orders](/lab/workflow/scheduled-orders)

In this document, we will focus on orderable panels/biomarkers.

### Markers

[_Markers_](/api-reference/lab-testing/biomarkers) are individual, orderable tests, at the lab level. So, for example, at _Labcorp_ you can order a `Lipid Panel` test and a `Vitamin D` test, a `panel` and a `biomarker` respectively. At Vital, these are both refered to as **markers**.

### Lab Tests

[_Lab Tests_](/api-reference/lab-testing/post-test) are a collection of markers, or a preset combination of markers, that you can order. Using the example above, you can create a `Labcorp Lipid Panel and Vitamin D` lab test. You can then place orders at Vital using this preset. This is useful for situations where you repeatedly want to order the same markers.


# Ordering 

When placing an [Order](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order), you will see an `order_set` field. This is what defines what markers will be ordered.

There are multiple combinations allowed with this field, so let's explore all of them.

### Ordering a _Lab Test_

When ordering from **one** previously created _Lab Test_, the `order_set` field should be populated as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

client.lab_tests.create_order(
        order_set=OrderSet(
            lab_test_ids=["lab_test_id"]
        )
        ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ordering from multiple _Lab Tests_

You may want to combine two or more existing Lab Tests without creating a new one. This is possible by doing:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

client.lab_tests.create_order(
        order_set=OrderSet(
            lab_test_ids=["lab_test_id1", "lab_test_id_2"]
        )
        ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ordering without a _Lab Test_ 

This is what Vital calls `à la carte` ordering. You may want to order from the marker compendium without creating a preset.

<Note>
This is a team level configuration that must be requested from Vital. Not all markers can be ordered in this manner. 
</Note>

It is possible to order `a-la-carte` using Vital `marker_ids` or the lab's `provider_id`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

client.lab_tests.create_order(
        order_set=OrderSet(
            add_on=AddOn(
                provider_ids=["322022"]
                # marker_ids=[1] 
            )
        ),
        collection_method="walk_in_test",
        ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Order _Lab Tests_ with extra _Markers_

You may also add extra **markers** to an order. For example, you want to order the `Labcorp Lipid Panel and Vitamin D` but for this particular patient, you also want to order a `CBC Panel`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

client.lab_tests.create_order(
        order_set=OrderSet(
            lab_test_ids=["lab_test_id"],
            add_on=AddOn(
                provider_ids=["322022"]
                # marker_ids=[1] 
            )
        ),
        collection_method="walk_in_test",
        ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
When supplying the `add_on` field, it is always required to provide the `collection_method` field.
</Note>


## Collection Method

Further explored in the documentation, Vital also has the concept of _Collection Method_. Vital currently supports three methods, [`At Home Phlebotomy`](lab/at-home-phlebotomy/overview), [`Walk In Phlebotomy`](lab/walk-in/overview) and [`Testkits`](lab/testkits/overview).
When ordering, you must select one of these, either at lab test creation, or at ordering time.


<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

client.lab_tests.create_order(
        order_set=OrderSet(
            lab_test_ids=["lab_test_id"],
        ),
        collection_method="walk_in_test",
        ...
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## À La Carte Markers

As mentioned above, not all `markers` are `a la carte` orderable. You can find which one's are orderable via the [GET /v3/lab_tests/markers](/api-reference/lab-testing/biomarkers).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vital.client import Vital
from vital.environment import VitalEnvironment

client = Vital(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment=VitalEnvironment.SANDBOX
)

markers = client.lab_tests.get_markers(
        name="322022",
        a_la_carte_enabled=True
)

if not all([m.a_la_carte_enabled for m in markers.markers]):
    raise Exception("Markers not a_la_carte_enabled")
```
</CodeGroup>



## Error Cases

With the existance of various allowed combinations with the `order_set` field, there's many validations that are done server side. Here are some of the errors you can expect to encounter:

### 400 Bad Request

1. `collection_method must be set if add_on is set`: When the `add_on` field is supplied, you must provide the `collection_method`.
2. `marker_ids or provider_ids must be set in add_on`: One of `marker_ids` or `provider_ids` must be set, if the `add_on` field is provided.
3. `cannot set both marker_ids and provider_ids in add_on`: Similarly, only one of the former fields can be provided.
4. `cannot order lab_tests from multiple labs`: You can only order multiple lab tests from the same lab.
5. `cannot order with lab tests with multiple collection methods`: You must supply a `collection_method` if ordering multiple lab tests with multiple collection methods.
6. `Lab <lab name> does not allow gender <gender value>`: The associated lab restricts which patient genders it accepts. This restriction applies to the entire lab, not to individual lab tests.
