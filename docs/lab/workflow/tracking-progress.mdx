title: "Tracking Progress"
---

Throughout the lifecyle of a test we update you on the status of the order via our webhooks.
When you first place an order, we send a `labtest.order.created` event. This means that we successfully received you order and started processing it. For subsequent events, we will send a `labtest.order.updated` update. Each webhook you receive have the
base order object with the updated parameters.

### Example

After ordering an at-home test kit, once the order is complete, picked by our warehouse
and is sent to the customer the order status will change to `collecting_sample.testkit.transit_customer`. And you will receive
the following webhook:x
