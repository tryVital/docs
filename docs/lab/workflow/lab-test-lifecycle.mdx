title: "Lab Test Lifecycle"

## Introduction

We encapsulate our lab test modalities in the `order` object. This is the main object you will interact with, as it contains all the information related to that lab test. An order has a high-level status which represents where the order is throughout its lifecycle, e.g. received/delivered/completed/cancelled etc.

The high-level status is the same across test modalities. On top of that, each modality has its own sub-statuses, to represents lifecycle stages specific to that modality. For example, test-kits involve shipping of the box, so we have a whole set of statuses to track the shipment.

## Statuses

Statuses are namespaced with the following format:

```[HIGH-LEVEL STATUS].[TEST MODALITY].[LOW-LEVEL STATUS]```

As an example, the status `collecting_sample.at_home_phlebotomy.appointment_scheduled` means the patient has scheduled an at-home phlebotomy appointment.

### High-level statuses

The high-level statuses of an order, are represented by `order.status`:

- `received`: we received the order, stored it into our system, and started processing it.
- `collecting_sample`: these track collecting the sample from the patient. In the case of test-kits, these track the shipment of the kit. For at-home phlebotomy, these track the patient scheduling an appointment. Walk-in tests don't have this status because the patient can turn up at the lab anytime.
- `sample_with_lab`: the lab received the sample and is currently analyzing it.
- `completed`: the order is complete and the results are ready.
- `cancelled`: the order has been cancelled, by you or the patient.
- `failed`: we failed to process the order.

Modality specific sub-statuses are encapsulated in the `order.events` list. These include a list of all the events for that test:

```json Test kit order status
{
        ...,
        "status": "cancelled",
        "events": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "received.testkit.ordered",
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "received.testkit.requisition_created",
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "collecting_sample.testkit.transit_customer"
            },
    ],
}
```

Below is a full list of all the available statuses by test modality. The names should be self-descriptive. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need any additional clarification!

## Critical Results

When our Lab partners return results to Vital, they may return specific interpretations for each Marker:

- `normal`, the marker value is inside the lab reference range.
- `abnormal`, the marker value is outside the lab reference range.
- `critical`, the marker value falls in the critical range for that marker, which can be life-threatening.

These values are returned in an `interpretation` field for results, both in each individual marker and the overall results object:

```json Resuls Object
{
  "metadata": {
    "age": 19,
    "dob": "18/08/1993",
    "clia_number": "12331231",
    "patient": "Bob Smith",
    "provider": "Dr. Jack Smith",
    "laboratory": "LabCorp",
    "date_reported": "2020-01-01",
    "date_collected": "2022-02-02",
    "specimen_number": "123131",
    "date_received": "2022-01-01",
    "status": "final",
    "interpretation": "critical"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Hemoglobin",
      "slug": "hemoglobin",
      "unit": "g/dL",
      "notes": null,
      "value": 100.2,
      "timestamp": null,
      "max_range_value": 17.7,
      "min_range_value": 13.0,
      "is_above_max_range": true,
      "is_below_min_range": false,
      "interpretation": "critical"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sodium",
      "slug": "unknown",
      "unit": "mmol/L",
      "notes": null,
      "value": 136,
      "timestamp": null,
      "max_range_value": 144,
      "min_range_value": 134,
      "is_above_max_range": false,
      "is_below_min_range": false,
      "interpretation": "normal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Besides the `interpretation` field, there is also the `status` field, which can assume the values of `final` or `partial`, as the critical results are notified as soon as they're available, not all tests are guaranteed to have been processed by the lab.

For critical results, the Lab that published the results must call a physician to contact the patient to inform them about the critical results and give the correct orientation. The physician called will be the Vital assigned physician who acts as the ordering physician when placing the Lab Test order. After the call has been made and Vital has received the results from the Lab, a `labtest.result.critical` event will be fired to customers, with the webhook payload containing the following information:

```json Critical Results Webhook Payload
{
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2023-09-04T19:02:33.042533+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2023-09-04T19:02:47.106778+00:00",
    "order_id": "93ae03a7-626f-4cf4-802b-1fb6b3c339c7",
    "sample_id": "W4123LKB3VTL",
    "status": "final",
    "interpretation": "critical",
    "team_id": "482gh249-cd9d-4049-bb42-db5682cdf1d2",
    "user_id": "db5d34d5-bf7b-4e25-b119-9asd53694f45"
  },
  "event_type": "labtest.result.critical"
}
```

After you receive the webhook, you can use the [`GET /order/{order_id}/result`](/api-reference/results/get-results) endpoint to fetch the raw results.
