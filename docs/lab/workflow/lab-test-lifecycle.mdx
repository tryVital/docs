title: "Lab Test Lifecycle"

## Introduction

We encapsulate our lab test modalities in the `order` object. This is the main object you will interact with, as it contains all the information related to that lab test. An order has a high-level status which represents where the order is throughout its lifecycle, e.g. received/delivered/completed/cancelled etc.

The high-level status is the same across test modalities. On top of that, each modality has its own sub-statuses, to represents lifecycle stages specific to that modality. For example, test-kits involve shipping of the box, so we have a whole set of statuses to track the shipment.

## Statuses

Statuses are namespaced with the following format:

```[HIGH-LEVEL STATUS].[TEST MODALITY].[LOW-LEVEL STATUS]```

As an example, the status `collecting_sample.at_home_phlebotomy.appointment_scheduled` means the patient has scheduled an at-home phlebotomy appointment.

### High-level statuses

The high-level statuses of an order, are represented by `order.status`:

- `received`: we received the order, stored it into our system, and started processing it.
- `collecting_sample`: these track collecting the sample from the patient. In the case of test-kits, these track the shipment of the kit. For at-home phlebotomy, these track the patient scheduling an appointment. Walk-in tests don't have this status because the patient can turn up at the lab anytime.
- `sample_with_lab`: the lab received the sample and is currently analyzing it.
- `completed`: the order is complete and the results are ready.
- `cancelled`: the order has been cancelled, by you or the patient.
- `failed`: we failed to process the order.

Modality specific sub-statuses are encapsulated in the `order.events` list. These include a list of all the events for that test:

```json Test kit order status
{
        ...,
        "status": "cancelled",
        "events": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "received.testkit.ordered",
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "received.testkit.requisition_created",
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "status": "collecting_sample.testkit.transit_customer"
            },
    ],
}
```
