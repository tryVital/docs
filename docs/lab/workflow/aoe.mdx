Some biomarkers require answers to clinical questions, this is referred to as AOE. These can be as simple as the volume of a particular marker, or the ethnicity of the patient.

<Note>
Questions that are related to fasting (e.g  code `FSTING`) do not need to be answered, even tho they are marked as `required`. We use the default value you provided for fasting at the [lab test](/api-reference/lab-testing/post-test) creation time.
</Note>


There are 4 types of AOE:

1. `choice`
2. `multiple_choice`
3. `numeric`
4. `text`

`choice` and `multiple_choice` have a set list of answers to pick from, while `numeric` and `text` don't and are free form responses.

AOE questions can also be required or optional.

## Where to find the questions

As these AOE are directly related to biomarkers, you can find them in the [`GET /v3/lab_tests/markers`](/api-reference/lab-testing/biomarkers) endpoint or in the [`GET /v3/lab_tests/{lab_test_id}/markers`](/api-reference/lab-testing/lab-test-markers) endpoint, in the `aoe` object.

As an example, let's look at the `Lead, Blood (Adult)` marker. We have omitted some extra questions for the sake of this doc.

```json
{
  "id": 173,
  "name": "Lead, Blood (Adult)",
  "provider_id": "007625",
  ...
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1234567890251,
      "code": "BLPURP",
      "type": "choice",
      "value": "BLOOD LEAD PURPOSE",
      "constraint": null,
      "answers": [
        {
          "id": 1234567890252,
          "code": "LCANS4",
          "value": "I - INITIAL"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890253,
          "code": "LCANS5",
          "value": "R - REPEAT"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890254,
          "code": "LCANS6",
          "value": "F - FOLLOW-UP"
        }
      ],
      "required": true,
      "sequence": 1
    },
  ]
`
```

Each question has it's own `id`, which will be required to answer it. The types we refer to above are an enum that is represented by `type`.

The `answers` list contains a list of possible answers in the case that `type` is one of `choice` or `multiple_choice`, otherwise it is empty.

`required` deems whether the questions MUST be answered in order for the order to be valid, otherwise a error will be shown `Missing required questions - "question"`.

## How to answer

Answering is done at order time, via the [`POST /v3/order`](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order) endpoint, in the field `aoe_answers`.

This field has the following format:

```json
{
    "aoe_answers": [
        {
            "marker_id": <int>,
            "question_id": <int>,
            "answer": <str>,
        }
    ]
}
```

You will populate this list with the answers to the questions defined in the `marker` object, as explained [above](/lab/workflow/aoe#where-to-find-the-questions).

The `marker_id` refers to the Vital [marker id](/api-reference/lab-testing/biomarkers), and the `question_id` to the id of the question being answered.

For example, marker `Leader, Blood (Adult)`, has the following data:

```json
{
  "id": 173,
  "name": "Lead, Blood (Adult)",
  "provider_id": "007625",
  ...
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1234567890251,
      "code": "BLPURP",
      "type": "choice",
      "value": "BLOOD LEAD PURPOSE",
      "constraint": null,
      "answers": [
        {
          "id": 1234567890252,
          "code": "LCANS4",
          "value": "I - INITIAL"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890253,
          "code": "LCANS5",
          "value": "R - REPEAT"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890254,
          "code": "LCANS6",
          "value": "F - FOLLOW-UP"
        }
      ],
      "required": true,
      "sequence": 1
    },
  ]
```

In order to answer the required question, you will need the `marker_id` which is the `id` field, the `question_id` in `questions[0].id` and one of the `code` values in the `question[0].answers` field.

### Answer types

The `answer` field contains the actual answer to the question and it's value will depend on the type and question itself.

1. `choice` and `multiple_choice`

In this case, the `answer` should contain the `code` field in the list of `answers` provided, as shown [here](/lab/workflow/aoe#where-to-find-the-questions).

e.g The question is as follows for marker of id `173`:
```json
{
  "id": 173,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1234567890251,
      "code": "BLPURP",
      "type": "choice",
      "value": "BLOOD LEAD PURPOSE",
      "constraint": null,
      "answers": [
        {
          "id": 1234567890252,
          "code": "LCANS4",
          "value": "I - INITIAL"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890253,
          "code": "LCANS5",
          "value": "R - REPEAT"
        },
        {
          "id": 1234567890254,
          "code": "LCANS6",
          "value": "F - FOLLOW-UP"
        }
      ],
      "required": true,
      "sequence": 1
    },
  ]
}
```

The answer is:
```json
{
    "aoe_answers": [
        {
            "marker_id": 173,
            "question_id": 1234567890251,
            "answer": "LCANS4",
        }
    ]
}
```

2. `text`

This case can encompass many responses, and depends on the question itself.

<Note>
In some instances, the `text` case contains a `constraint` field. This is a string tooltip indicator of the constraints applied by the lab on this particular question.
</Note>

e.g The question is as follows for marker of id `173`:
```json
{
  "id": 173,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1234567890304,
      "code": "EDDATE",
      "type": "text",
      "constraint": null,
      "value": "EDD/EDC DATE",
      "answers": [],
      "required": true,
      "sequence": 2
    }, 
  ]
}
```

The answer is:
```json
{
    "aoe_answers": [
        {
            "marker_id": 173,
            "question_id": 1234567890304,
            "answer": "19900101",
        }
    ]
}
```

3. `numeric`

In this case, the `answer` should be a numeric string representation of the actual value.

e.g The question is as follows for marker of id `173`:
```json
{
  "id": 173,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1234567890240,
      "code": "COLVOL",
      "type": "numeric",
      "constraint": null,
      "value": "URINE VOLUME (MILLILITERS)",
      "answers": [],
      "required": true,
      "sequence": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The answer is:
```json
{
    "aoe_answers": [
        {
            "marker_id": 173,
            "question_id": 1234567890240,
            "answer": "1000",
        }
    ]
}
```
