title: "Partial Result Notifications"
---

Orders may have partial results, meaning that the lab has made available part of the result, while the full result is not complete. In general, these are short lived and as such, Vital does not expose them via webhooks.
Some orders however have long lived partial results, specifically when one ordered marker takes significantly longer to result then the others. 

In these situations, clients may want to be notified of the existance of partial results. As such, Vital provides a team level configuration that enables the delivery of partial result webhooks. Similarly to other events, these are triggered via a `labtest.order.updated` event in the system.

Orders can also experience multiple partials in their lifecycle. In these cases, Vital will send a webhook for each partial update. So if your order experiences two partial results before a final, complete result, you should expect to receive two `labtest.order.updated` webhooks with `partial` status.

For example, in the second partial result, you would receive a webhook with the following body:

<Note>Note that the `events` block contains two `sample_with_lab.walk_in_test.partial_results` events.</Note>
