### Consents

When you order a lab test through our API, you may have to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents may include:

- `hipaa-authorization`.
- `terms-of-use`.
- `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument.
If provided, the order will use your physician. If not, your order will go through with Vital's physician network. For more information, please check [our lab testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and [book an introductory call with us](https://cal.com/team/vital/discovery-call).

### Patient Name Validation

Patient names in the Vital API must conform to a specific regex pattern due to lab restrictions. This validation applies to all name fields including `first_name`, `last_name`, and `receiver_name`.

#### Validation Pattern

```
^([a-zA-Z0-9]{1})([a-zA-Z0-9-.,']*(\s[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']+)*[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']?)$
```

#### Pattern Breakdown

- `^([a-zA-Z0-9]{1})` - Must start with exactly one alphanumeric character (letter or number)
- `([a-zA-Z0-9-.,']*` - Followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters, hyphens, periods, commas, or apostrophes
- `(\s[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']+)*` - Zero or more groups of: space followed by one or more valid characters
- `[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']?)$` - Optionally ends with a valid character (not space)

#### Validation Rules

**Allowed Characters:**
- Letters (a-z, A-Z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Hyphens (-)
- Periods (.)
- Commas (,)
- Apostrophes (')
- Spaces (only between words)

**Requirements:**
- Must start with an alphanumeric character (not space, hyphen, or punctuation)
- Spaces are only allowed between words
- Cannot start or end with a space
- Cannot have consecutive spaces

#### Valid Examples

```
John
Mary-Jane
O'Connor
Dr. Smith
Jean-Pierre
```

#### Invalid Examples

```
 John          // Starts with space
John           // Ends with space
-John          // Starts with hyphen
John@Smith     // Contains @ symbol
José           // Contains accented character (í)
María          // Contains accented character (í)
François       // Contains accented character (ç)
```

#### Error Message

When validation fails, the API returns:

"The field must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z or 0-9) and can only contain -,. special characters, but cannot start with a space or hyphen."


### Minors

Ordering for minors (under 18 years old) requires a specific configuration, which you can request with your Junction Customer Success Manager.

Once enabled, you are able to order for a minor patient, by providing information regarding the medical proxy.

This information can be supplied at [ordering time](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order#body-patient-details-medical-proxy), or at any time by updating the [user demographics](/api-reference/user/upsert-info#body-medical-proxy).
