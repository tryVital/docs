### Consents

When you order a lab test through our API, you may have to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents may include:

- `hipaa-authorization`.
- `terms-of-use`.
- `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument.
If provided, the order will use your physician. If not, your order will go through with Vital's physician network. For more information, please check [our lab testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and [book an introductory call with us](https://cal.com/team/vital/discovery-call).

### Patient Name Validation

Patient names must conform to a specific regex pattern due to lab restrictions. This validation applies to all name fields including `first_name` and `last_name`.

**Regex Pattern:**
```
^([a-zA-Z0-9]{1})([a-zA-Z0-9-.,']*(\s[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']+)*[a-zA-Z0-9-.,']?)$
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Must start with an alphanumeric character (not space, hyphen, or punctuation)
- Only allows letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), periods (.), commas (,), apostrophes (')
- Spaces are only allowed between words
- Cannot start or end with a space
- Cannot have consecutive spaces

**Valid Name Examples:**
- `John`
- `Mary-Jane` 
- `O'Connor`
- `Dr. Smith`
- `Jean-Pierre`

**Invalid Name Examples:**
- ` John` (starts with space)
- `John ` (ends with space)
- `-John` (starts with hyphen)
- `John@Smith` (contains @)
- `Jos√©` (contains accented character)


### Minors

Ordering for minors (under 18 years old) requires a specific configuration, which you can request with your Junction Customer Success Manager.

Once enabled, you are able to order for a minor patient, by providing information regarding the medical proxy.

This information can be supplied at [ordering time](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order#body-patient-details-medical-proxy), or at any time by updating the [user demographics](/api-reference/user/upsert-info#body-medical-proxy).
