### Consents

When you order a lab test through our API, you may have to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents may include:

- `hipaa-authorization`.
- `terms-of-use`.
- `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument.
If provided, the order will use your physician. If not, your order will go through with Vital's physician network. For more information, please check [our lab testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and [book an introductory call with us](https://cal.com/team/vital/discovery-call).

### Minors

Ordering for minors (under 18 years old) requires a specific configuration, which you can request with you Junction Customer Success Manager.

Once enabled, you are able to order for a minor patient, by providing information regarding the medical proxy.

This information can be supplied at [ordering time](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order#body-patient-details-medical-proxy), or at any time by updating the [user demographics](/api-reference/user/upsert-info#body-medical-proxy).
