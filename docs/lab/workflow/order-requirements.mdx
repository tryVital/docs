### Consents

When you order a lab test through our API, you may have to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents may include:
* `hipaa-authorization`.
* `terms-of-use`.
* `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument.
If provided, the order will use your physician. If not, your order will go through with Vital's physician network. For more information, please check [our lab testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and [book an introductory call with us](https://cal.com/team/vital/discovery-call).
