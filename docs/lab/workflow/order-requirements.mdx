### Consents

When you order a test through our API, you'll need to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents are required:

* `hipaa-authorization`.
* `terms-of-use`.
* `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument. If provided, the order will make use of your own physician. If not provided, your order will go through with a physican from our own network. For more information, do not hesitate to head over [our testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and book an introductory call with us.

### Health insurance (Beta)

When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `health_insurance` argument to signal that this order should use Health Insurance as the billing method. Sometimes a private `physician` may also be needed depending on the lab partner.
Currently, we support Health Insurance orders for two of our partner labs, described in the following subsections:

#### Spiriplex

For placing insurance orders with Spiriplex, you will need some pre-requisites:

- A physician capable of signing a requisition form. We currently don't support insurance orders using our own private physician network.
- An image of the front and back of the Patient insurance card
- An image of the Patient signature
- Information about the patient reported symptoms and Physician assesment and treatment plan

You can provide this information in our API, using the `physician` and `health_insurance` arguments for the [POST v3/order/](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order) REST endpoint.

```json Health Insurance
{
"health_insurance":{
      "front_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded insurance front image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png | image/jpg | image/jpeg"
      },
      "back_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded insurance back image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png"
      },
      "patient_signature_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded patient signature image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png"
      },
      "subjective": "Description of what is the patient symptoms and attempted treatments",
      "assessment_plan": "Description of what is the physician assessment and treament or testing plan"
    }
}
```

```json Physician
{
"physician": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@doe.com",
    "npi": "123456789",
    "licensed_states": ["CA", "NY"],
    "signature_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded physician signature image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png"
      }
  }
}
```

After you place an order with the correct information, a requisition form will be generated and sent to Spiriplex with the necessary information so that you customer Health Insurance is correctly billed by Spiriplex.

#### Labcorp

To place an Order with Health Insurance as the billing method in Labcorp, you can use the `health_insurance` argument for the [POST v3/order/](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order) REST endpoint, providing the following required information:

- Payor Code - A unique code representing a specific Health Insurance company. You can query a specific Payor Code using the [Search Payor route](/api-reference/lab-testing-insurance/search-payor)
- Insurance ID - A unique alphanumerical number representing the patient contract with the Health Insurance company. Usually found in the patient's insurance card.
- Responsible Relationship - The relationship for the Insurance owner and the patient. The values are (Self, Spouse, Other Relationship). If the relationship is different from "Self", the Responsible Details field must be provided.
- Responsible Details - An object with specific information about the responsible, containing the Responsbile Phone Number, Name and Address.
- Diagnosis Codes - A list of Diagnosis Codes names, you can search for adequate diagnosis using the [Search Diagnosis Code route](/api-reference/lab-testing-insurance/search-diagnosis)

The `health_insurance` object should look like this:

```json Health Insurance
{
 "health_insurance": {
    "payor_code": "12345",
    "diagnosis_codes": ["123", "321"],
    "insurance_id": "12345",
    "responsible_relationship": "Spouse",
    "responsible_details": {
                "first_name": "first",
                "last_name": "last",
                "phone_number": "+11234567890",
                "phone_type": "Mobile",
                "address": {
                    "first_line": "address 123",
                    "country": "US",
                    "zip": "12345",
                    "city": "Cheyenne",
                    "state": "Wyoming"
                }
            }
  }
}
```

After you place the order, the information will be fowarded to Labcorp and a Requisition form will be generated, succesfully placing an order with Health Insurance billing.
