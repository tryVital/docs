### Consents

When you order a lab test through our API, you may have to collect consents from the patient and forward it to us. The following consents may include:
* `hipaa-authorization`.
* `terms-of-use`.
* `telehealth-informed-consent`.

### Physician

As mentioned [in the introduction](/lab/overview/introduction#features), you don't need to have your own Physician to place orders with Vital. When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you can pass an optional `physician` argument.
If provided, the order will use your physician. If not, your order will go through with Vital's physician network. For more information, please check [our lab testing page](https://tryvital.io/labs) and [book an introductory call with us](https://cal.com/team/vital/discovery-call).

### Health insurance (Beta)

When you [order a test](/lab/overview/quickstart#3-placing-an-order), you have the option to select Health Insurance as a billing method.
You can place a health insurance order by creating an order using the `health_insurance` argument in the [Create Order endpoint](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order), providing:

- Payor Code - A unique code representing a specific Health Insurance company. You can query a specific Payor Code using the [Search Payor endpoint](/api-reference/lab-testing-insurance/search-payor).
- Insurance ID - A unique alphanumerical number representing the patient contract with the Health Insurance company. Usually found in the patient's insurance card.
- Responsible Relationship - The relationship between the Insurance owner and the patient. The values are (`Self`, `Spouse`, `Other Relationship`). If the relationship is different from `Self`, the Responsible Details field must be provided.
- Responsible Details - An object with specific information about the responsible, containing the Responsible Partyâ€™s Phone Number, Name and Address.
- Diagnosis Codes - A list of Diagnosis Codes names, you can search for adequate diagnosis using the [Search Diagnosis Code endpoint](/api-reference/lab-testing-insurance/search-diagnosis).
- **Optional** A clear, legible image of the front and back of the Patient insurance card.

The `health_insurance` object should look like this:

```json Health Insurance
{
 "health_insurance": {
    "front_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded insurance front image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png | image/jpg | image/jpeg"
      },
      "back_image": {
         "content": "base64-encoded insurance back image binary content",
         "content_type": "image/png"
    },
    "payor_code": "SGEXS",
    "diagnosis_codes": ["D55.0"],
    "insurance_id": "12345",
    "responsible_relationship": "Spouse",
    "responsible_details": {
                "first_name": "John",
                "last_name": "Doe",
                "phone_number": "+11234567890",
                "phone_type": "Mobile",
                "address": {
                    "first_line": "3577 Berkshire Circle",
                    "country": "USA",
                    "zip": "37917",
                    "city": "Knoxville",
                    "state": "Tennessee"
                }
            }
  }
}
```

A successful order is created with health insurance billing, and sent to our partner labs to generate a requisition form.
