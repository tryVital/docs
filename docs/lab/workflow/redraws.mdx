<FeatureBeta />

A patient may be eligible for a redraw if their order has missing results due to a lab error. 
In these cases, rather than transitioning the [high-level status](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle) of the order to `completed`, the order status is set to `redraw_available`. 
A `labtest.order.updated` [webhook](/lab/walk-in/webhooks) will also be triggered with the `redraw_available` order event.

A patient can only get one redraw per order. The order status will transition to `completed` once the results of the redraw have been received.

<Warning>
Please note that this feature is only available for walk-in tests with Labcorp, Quest and BioReference.
