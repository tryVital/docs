Junction attempts to deliver each webhook message based on a retry schedule with exponential backoff.

## **The schedule**[**​**](https://docs.svix.com/retries#the-schedule)

Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is started following the failure of the preceding attempt:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## **Indicating successful delivery**[**​**](https://docs.svix.com/retries#indicating-successful-delivery)

The way to indicate that a webhook has been processed is by returning a `2xx` (status code `200-299`) response to the webhook message within a reasonable time-frame (15s ). Any other status code, including `3xx` redirects are treated as failures.

## **Failed delivery handling**[**​**](https://docs.svix.com/retries#failed-delivery-handling)

After the conclusion of the above attempts the message will be marked as `Failed` for this endpoint, and you will get a webhook of type `message.attempt.exhausted` notifying you of this error.

## **Disabling failing endpoints**[**​**](https://docs.svix.com/retries#disabling-failing-endpoints)

If all attempts to a specific endpoint fail for a period of 5 days, the endpoint will be disabled. The clock only starts after multiple deliveries failed within a 24 hour span, with at least 12 hours difference between the first and the last failure.

## **Manual retries**[**​**](https://docs.svix.com/retries#manual-retries)

You can also use the webhook portal in the dashboard to manually retry each message at any time, or automatically retry ("Recover") all failed messages starting from a given date.
