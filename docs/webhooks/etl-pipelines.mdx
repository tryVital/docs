<Info>
ETL Pipelines integration is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

[Events](/webhooks/introduction) can be published directly to a supported message queue source of
your ETL pipelines. This means you need not provision Internet reachable, unauthenticated HTTPS endpoints
in order to ingest Vital events as webhooks.

## Destinations

The following destinations are supported:

| Name | Authentication | Publication Order |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| RabbitMQ | Password | Depends on your RabbitMQ broker configuration. |
| Google Cloud Pub/Sub | IAM | [Pub/Sub Message Ordering](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering) is supported. |
| Azure Event Hub | [SAS Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas) | Depends on your Azure Event Hub configuration. |

## Event Schema

Webhooks, ETL Pipelines and our API endpoints all share the same JSON object schema. Webhooks and ETL Pipelines use
identical JSON event payload structure.

Check out our [Event Catalog](/event-catalog).

## Features

### Data compression

Vital does not compress payload blobs that are smaller than 1 KiB. Please refer to the destination-specific
documentation below on how to detect a compressed blob versus an uncompressed blob.

### Static outbound IPs

Vital establish connections to your ETL Pipeline destination through a static pool of IPs. Contact Vital support to
obtain the up-to-date static IP list.

### Double writing during transition

To ensure smooth switchover from Webhooks to your new ETL Pipelines destination, Vital supports double writing events
to the combination of:

* all your Webhook endpoints; and
* your ETL Pipelines destination.

### Pushed Historical Data

When you use ETL Pipelines, Vital can _push_ all the historical data as `daily.data.*` data events to your ETL Pipelines
destination.
The data-less `historical.data.*.created` event would still be emitted to denote the completion of historical pull.


## Configuring ETL Pipelines

You can change the ETL Pipelines configuration on your Teams at any time through the
[Set Team ETL Pipelines](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/org-management/team-etl-pipeline/upsert-team-etl-pipelines) endpoint
of the Org Management API.

Your new configuration is typically active as soon as the endpoint has acknowledged your request.

<Info>
Feel free to reach out Vital support if you need assisted setup, or if you need a Vital Org Key to access the Org Management API.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital with the following attributes:

| Type | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | event_type | Vital event type, e.g., daily.data.activity.created |
| Attribute | blob_type | json : UTF8 JSON document |
| Attribute | blob_codec | `gzip`: The blob is compressed by gzip. `null` or absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Attribute | idempotency_key | Unique key that allows detection of subsequent retries of the same request |
| Data | - | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |
| Ordering Key | - | Vital User ID (If you have enabled Message Ordering) |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any messages with unrecognized `blob_type` and `blob_codec`.
</Info>

### Pub/Sub message ordering

If you wish to receive message for each Vital user in their publication order, Vital supports Pub/Sub Message Ordering, and uses the Vital User ID as the message ordering key. 

Vital publishes all messages through the `us-central1` and `europe-west1` PubSub regional endpoints.

<Warning>
Pub/Sub Exactly Once Delivery is **discouraged** to be used together with Message Ordering. Our own trial suggested that the combination would struggle to move high volume of messages.
</Warning>

### IAM Permission

Grant the relevant IAM Principals on your topic with these pre-defined roles:

- Pub/Sub Publisher (`roles/pubsub.publisher`)
- Pub/Sub Viewer (`roles/pubsub.viewer`)

Or more specifically these permissions if you wish to create a custom IAM role with a minimized grant:

- `pubsub.topics.get`
- `pubsub.topics.publish`

| Environment | Region | Service Account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox | US | customer-topics-us@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Sandbox | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production | US | customer-topics-us@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |

## RabbitMQ

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital with the following attributes:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Routing Key | Vital event type, e.g., daily.data.activity.created |
| Content-Type | application/json : UTF8 JSON document |
| Content-Encoding | gzip: The blob is compressed by gzip. null/absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Data | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any messages with unrecognized `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding`.
</Info>

### Exchange requirements

Vital only supports password authentication at this time.

Vital publishes messages with the following settings:

- Publisher Confirm mode is required
- Messages are published with the Mandatory flag but without the Immediate flag.
- Messages are published with Event Type as the Routing Key.

Please get in touch if these need to be configured differently for your RabbitMQ exchange.


## Azure Event Hub

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital with the following attributes:

| Type | Key | Value |

| Attribute | blob_codec | `gzip`: The blob is compressed by gzip. `null` or absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Attribute | idempotency_key | Unique key that allows detection of subsequent retries of the same request |
| Data | - | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |
| Partition Key | - | Vital User ID |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>
