title: "ETL Pipelines"

<Info>
ETL Pipelines integration is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

[Events](/webhooks/introduction) can be published directly to a supported message queue source of
your ETL pipelines. This means you need not provision Internet reachable, unauthenticated HTTPS endpoints
in order to ingest Vital events as webhooks.

## Destinations

The following destinations are supported:

| Name | Authentication | Publication Order |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| RabbitMQ | Password | Depends on your RabbitMQ broker configuration. |
| Google Cloud Pub/Sub | IAM | [Pub/Sub Message Ordering](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering) is supported. |
| Azure Event Hub | [SAS Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas) | Depends on your Azure Event Hub configuration. |

For evaluation and zero downtime transition, Vital supports double writing both to your Svix webhook endpoints,
and to the message queue source of your ETL pipelines.

## Event Schema

Vital ETL Pipelines integration publishes all events in the exact same JSON schema as our default Svix webhook offering.
Check out our [Event Catalog](/event-catalog).

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital message queue with the following attributes:

| Type | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | event_type | Vital event type, e.g., daily.data.activity.created |
| Attribute | blob_type | json : UTF8 JSON document |
| Attribute | blob_codec | `gzip`: The blob is compressed by gzip. `null` or absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Attribute | idempotency_key | Unique key that allows detection of subsequent retries of the same request |
| Data | - | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |
| Ordering Key | - | Vital User ID (If you have enabled Message Ordering) |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital message queue publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any messages with unrecognized `blob_type` and `blob_codec`.
</Info>

### Pub/Sub message ordering

If you wish to receive message for each Vital user in their publication order, Vital message queue supports Pub/Sub Message Ordering, and uses the Vital User ID as the message ordering key. 

Vital message queue publishes all messages through the `us-central1` and `europe-west1` PubSub regional endpoints.

<Warning>
Pub/Sub Exactly Once Delivery is **discouraged** to be used together with Message Ordering. Our own trial suggested that the combination would struggle to move high volume of messages.
</Warning>

### IAM Permission

Grant the relevant IAM Principals on your topic with these pre-defined roles:

- Pub/Sub Publisher (`roles/pubsub.publisher`)
- Pub/Sub Viewer (`roles/pubsub.viewer`)

Or more specifically these permissions if you wish to create a custom IAM role with a minimized grant:

- `pubsub.topics.get`
- `pubsub.topics.publish`

| Environment | Region | Service Account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox | US | customer-topics-us@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Sandbox | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production | US | customer-topics-us@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |

### Information needed by Vital

When you have completed the setup, please provide Vital the following information:

- Your Google Cloud Project ID
- Your Cloud Pub/Sub Topic name
- Whether or not you want messages to be published under Pub/Sub Message Ordering
- Whether or not you want larger blobs (≥ 1KiB) to be gzipped

## RabbitMQ

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital message queue with the following attributes:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Routing Key | Vital event type, e.g., daily.data.activity.created |
| Content-Type | application/json : UTF8 JSON document |
| Content-Encoding | gzip: The blob is compressed by gzip. null/absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Data | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital message queue publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any messages with unrecognized `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding`.
</Info>

### Exchange requirements

Vital message queue only supports password authentication at this time.

Vital message queue publishes messages with the following settings:

- Publisher Confirm mode is required
- Messages are published with the Mandatory flag but without the Immediate flag.
- Messages are published with Event Type as the Routing Key.

Please get in touch if these need to be configured differently for your RabbitMQ exchange.

### Information needed by Vital

When you have completed the setup, please provide Vital the following information:

- An `ampqs://` connection string with username and password embedded
- Whether or not you want larger blobs (≥ 1KiB) to be gzipped.

## Azure Event Hub

### Information needed by Vital

When you have completed the setup, please provide Vital the following information:

- A [connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string) of the following format:  `Endpoint=sb://<NamespaceName>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=<KeyName>;SharedAccessKey=<KeyValue>`
