# Event Structure

Each event is published with these Cloud Pub/Sub message attributes:

| Type | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | `event-type` | Vital event type, e.g., `daily.data.activity.created` |
| Attribute | `blob-type` | `json` : UTF8 JSON document |
| Attribute | `blob-codec` | `gzip`: The blob is compressed by gzip. `null` or absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Attribute | `idempotency-key` | The event delivery ID; only unique amongst all events from the same user and of the same event type. |
| Ordering Key | - | Vital User ID (If you have enabled Event Ordering) |

<Info>
Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed. You must check `blob_codec` to identify if decompression of
the message payload blob is necessary.
</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob-type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any events with unrecognized `blob-type` and `blob-codec`.
</Info>

## Pub/Sub event ordering

If you wish to receive event for each Vital user in their publication order, Vital supports Pub/Sub Event Ordering, and uses the Vital User ID as the event ordering key. 

Vital publishes all events through the `us-central1` and `europe-west1` PubSub regional endpoints.

<Warning>
Pub/Sub Exactly Once Delivery is **discouraged** to be used together with Event Ordering. Our own trial suggested that the combination would struggle to move high volume of events.
</Warning>

## IAM Permission

Grant the relevant IAM Principals on your topic with these pre-defined roles:

- Pub/Sub Publisher (`roles/pubsub.publisher`)
- Pub/Sub Viewer (`roles/pubsub.viewer`)

Or more specifically these permissions if you wish to create a custom IAM role with a minimized grant:

- `pubsub.topics.get`
- `pubsub.topics.publish`

| Environment | Region | Service Account |
| ----------- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox     | US | customer-topics-us@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Sandbox     | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production  | US | customer-topics-us@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |

## Configuration

<OrgManagementAPI />

You can manage your RabbitMQ destination through the Org Management API
[Team ETL Pipeline](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/org-management/team-etl-pipeline/upsert-team-etl-pipelines) endpoints.

A basic configuration would look as such:

```json
{
  "team_id": "TEAM_ID",
  "preferences": {
    "enabled": ["cloud_pubsub"],
    "preferred": "cloud_pubsub",
  },
  "cloud_pubsub": {
      "project": "my-gcp-project-123456",
      "topic": "event-ingestion",
      "message_ordering": true
  },
  "push_historical_data": true
}
```
