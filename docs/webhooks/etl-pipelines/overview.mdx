<Info>
ETL Pipelines integration is available for [the Scale plan](https://tryvital.io/pricing).
</Info>

With ETL Pipelines, Vital streams all [Vital events](/webhooks/event-structure) continuously to a supported destination
over direct authenticated TLS connections. Compared to [Webhooks](/webhooks/introduction), this simplifies your operational
complexity by removing the need to operate public unauthenticated HTTPS endpoints for receiving incoming Webhooks.

## Destinations

The following destinations are supported:

<Card horizontal href="/webhooks/etl-pipelines/google-cloud-pubsub" title="Google Cloud Pub/Sub" icon="google" />
<Card horizontal href="/webhooks/etl-pipelines/rabbitmq" title="RabbitMQ" icon="rabbit" />
<Card horizontal href="/webhooks/etl-pipelines/azure-event-hubs" title="Azure Event Hubs" icon="microsoft" />

## Event Schema

Webhooks, ETL Pipelines and our API endpoints all share the same JSON object schema. Webhooks and ETL Pipelines use
identical JSON event payload structure.

Check out our [Event Catalog](/event-catalog).

## Features

### Data compression

Vital does not compress payload blobs that are smaller than 1 KiB. Please refer to the destination-specific
documentation below on how to detect a compressed blob versus an uncompressed blob.

### Static outbound IPs

Vital establish connections to your ETL Pipeline destination through a static pool of IPs. Contact Vital support to
obtain the up-to-date static IP list.

### Double writing for migration

To ensure smooth switchover from Webhooks to your new ETL Pipelines destination, Vital supports double writing events
to the combination of:

* all your Webhook endpoints; and
* your ETL Pipelines destination.

<Info>
This is not a proper fan-out feature, and is only intended to aid customers evaluating and one-off migrating
between destinations.

There can only be one _preferred_ destination, and the secondary destination(s) do not enjoy the same reliability
guarantee as the _preferred_ one.
</Info>

### Pushed Historical Data

When you use ETL Pipelines, Vital can _push_ all the historical data as `daily.data.*` data events to your ETL Pipelines
destination.
The data-less `historical.data.*.created` event would still be emitted to denote the completion of historical pull.


## Configuring ETL Pipelines

You can change the ETL Pipelines configuration on your Teams at any time through the
[Set Team ETL Pipelines](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/org-management/team-etl-pipeline/upsert-team-etl-pipelines) endpoint
of the Org Management API.

Your new configuration is typically active as soon as the endpoint has acknowledged your request.

Refer to the destination-specific documentation for configuration examples.

<Info>
Feel free to reach out Vital support if you need assisted setup, or if you need a Vital Org Key to access the Org Management API.
