## Event Structure

Each event is published with these RabbitMQ message custom headers:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Routing Key | Vital event type, e.g., `daily.data.activity.created` |
| `Content-Type` | application/json : UTF8 JSON document |
| `Content-Encoding` | gzip: The blob is compressed by gzip. null/absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Data | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed â€” see blob_codec. |

<Info>
Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed. You must check `Content-Encoding` to identify if
decompression of the message payload blob is necessary.
</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any events with unrecognized `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding`.
</Info>

## Broker authentication

Vital only supports password authentication at this time.

Vital publishes events with the following settings:

- Publisher Confirm mode is required
- Events are published with the Mandatory flag but without the Immediate flag.
- Events are published with Event Type as the Routing Key.

Please get in touch if these need to be configured differently for your RabbitMQ exchange.

## Configuration

<OrgManagementAPI />

You can manage your RabbitMQ destination through the Org Management API
[Team ETL Pipeline](https://docs.tryvital.io/api-reference/org-management/team-etl-pipeline/upsert-team-etl-pipelines) endpoints.

A basic configuration would look as such:

```json
{
  "team_id": "TEAM_ID",
  "preferences": {
    "enabled": ["rabbitmq"],
    "preferred": "rabbitmq",
  },
  "rabbitmq": {
      "uri": "amqps://...",
      "exchange": "default"
  },
  "push_historical_data": true
}
```
