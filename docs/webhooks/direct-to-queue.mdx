title: "Direct to Queue"
---

As your userbase increases, you may be considering message queues as a solution to ingest the ever-growing volume of
Vital data events. For [Enterprise customers](https://tryvital.io/pricing), Vital offers Direct-to-Queue options to
send compressed data events directly to your message queue.

## Destinations

The following Direct-to-Queue destinations are supported:

| Name | Authentication | Publication Order |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| RabbitMQ | Password | Depends on your RabbitMQ broker configuration. |
| Google Cloud Pub/Sub | IAM | [Pub/Sub Message Ordering](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering) is supported. |

For evaluation and zero downtime transition, Vital supports double writing to both your production Svix endpoints,
and your new Direct-to-Queue destination.

## Event Schema

Vital Direct to Queue publishes all events in the exact same JSON schema as our default Svix webhook offering.
Check out our [Event Catalog](/event-catalog).

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### Message Structure

Each message would be published by Vital Direct-to-Queue with the following attributes:

| Type | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | event_type | Vital event type, e.g., daily.data.activity.created |
| Attribute | blob_type | json : UTF8 JSON document |
| Attribute | blob_codec | `gzip`: The blob is compressed by gzip. `null` or absent: The blob is uncompressed. |
| Data | - | Encoded JSON blob. This may or may not be compressed — see blob_codec. |
| Ordering Key | - | Vital User ID (If you have enabled Message Ordering) |

<Info>Payload smaller than 1KiB would not be compressed.</Info>

<Info>
At this time, Vital Direct-to-Queue publishes exclusively JSON blobs (`blob_type == json`).

Having said that, you are strongly encouraged to check for and drop any messages with unrecognized `blob_type` and `blob_codec`.
</Info>

### Pub/Sub message ordering

If you wish to receive message for each Vital user in their publication order, Vital Direct-to-Queue supports Pub/Sub Message Ordering, and uses the Vital User ID as the message ordering key. 

Vital Direct-to-Queue publishes all messages through the `us-central1` and `europe-west1` PubSub regional endpoints.

<Warning>
Pub/Sub Exactly Once Delivery is **discouraged** to be used together with Message Ordering. Our own trial suggested that the combination would struggle to move high volume of messages.
</Warning>

### IAM Permission

Grant the relevant IAM Principals on your topic with these pre-defined roles:

- Pub/Sub Publisher (`roles/pubsub.publisher`)
- Pub/Sub Viewer (`roles/pubsub.viewer`)

Or more specifically these permissions if you wish to create a custom IAM role with a minimized grant:

- `pubsub.topics.get`
- `pubsub.topics.publish`

| Environment | Region | Service Account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox | US | customer-topics-us@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Sandbox | Europe | customer-topics-eu@vital-sandbox.iam.gserviceaccount.com |
| Production | US | customer-topics-us@vital-prod-307415.iam.gserviceaccount.com |

- An `ampqs://` connection string with username and password embedded
