### Asynchronous execution

The Bulk Trigger Historical Pull endpoint enqueues all trigger requests you submitted to a persistent background operation. It then responds
*202 Created* immediately afterwards.

You can inspect the status of the resulting background operation through the [List Bulk Ops](/api-reference/link/list-bulk-ops) endpoint.

Optionally, you may opt into the `wait_for_completion` mode, which would respond 200 OK only if the operation does complete within 20 seconds.
Otherwise, the endpoint responds 202 Created.

<Note>
You can trigger historical pull on any number of — or even all — connections through the Bulk Trigger Historical Pull API within a short period
of time. Enqueuing is fast and does not disrupt the progress of the background operation. 
</Note>

#### Managing provider API rate limits

Junction transparently batches and throttles the trigger requests. This is to avoid exhausting the provider API rate limits of your Bring Your Own OAuth
custom credentials.

You can submit as many trigger requests as needed.


Provider            | Historical Pull triggering Rate
------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------
Garmin              | 2 connections every 1 minute
Fitbit, Polar       | 250 connections at a time; no time-based throttling
Strava              | 1 connections every 15 minutes
Oura                | 150 connections every 5 minutes
Withings            | 8 connections every 1 minute, with the assumption of your app using [Withings Enterprise Plan](https://developer.withings.com/developer-guide/v3/withings-solutions/withings-api-plans/).
All other providers | 8 connections every 1 minute


#### Historical Pull Range

Bulk Trigger Historical Pull respects any restricting [User Ingestion Bounds](/wearables/providers/data-ingestion-bounds) and/or any
[Team Data Pull Preferences](/wearables/providers/introduction#customizing-historical-data-pull-range) you have specified.

If you have specified a large number of days to pull, you should be aware that:

1. The background operation will take longer time to run to completion.
1. It may still cause temporary disruption to data polling and webhook processing, even after the triggering having been throttled.
