<ConnectionMigration />

Import existing provider connections to your [Bring Your Own OAuth](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring-your-own-oauth/overview) application credentials.

Before migrating any connection through this endpoint, you must first
[configure your BYOO app credential](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring-your-own-oauth/overview#setting-up-your-oauth-credentials) for the data provider
on your Vital Team.


Note that these connections cannot be migrated:

1. Any connection that is bound to an OAuth application credential not in your possession 

2. Any connection that is not bound to the OAuth application credential set on your Vital Team.
