## Overview

Diagnose user data unavailability through the User Resources Introspection API.

This API offers detailed insights into all provider connections and collected resources of all users in your team, empowering you to perform an initial diagnosis of any user connection issue with ease.

<Warning>
Please note that `user_limit` is an upper bound and the endpoint can return data for fewer users.
This would be the case if any of the top selected users had no available resource information.
