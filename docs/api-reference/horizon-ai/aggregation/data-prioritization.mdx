title: Data Prioritization
---

## Overview

Data prioritization automatically kicks in whenever you use a [Group By clause](/api-reference/horizon-ai/query-dsl/group-by-clause).

Within each group outlined by your [Group By clause](/api-reference/horizon-ai/query-dsl/group-by-clause), the query executor would **implicitly**:

* Sub-group the data further by their Provider and their [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions);
* Keep only data from the sub-group that has the highest Source Type priority, or the highest Provider priority when multiple sub-group
  exists for the same Source Type.

<Note>
Data prioritization works only in a [Group By](/api-reference/horizon-ai/query-dsl/group-by-clause) context.
</Note>

<Note>
If both the _Provider_ and _Source Type_ Source Columns are present in the [Group By clause](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/group-by-clause),
the implicit [Data Prioritization](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/data-prioritization) behaviour would be disabled.

<Accordion title="Example" defaultOpen>
You are querying Sleep Score grouped by every 1 day:

```json
{
    "select": [
        { "func": "newest", { "value_macro": "sleep_score" } }
    ],
    "group_by": [
        { "date_trunc": { "value": 1, "unit": "day }, "arg": { "index": "sleep" } }
    ]
}
```

Assuming this timeline:

* Day 1: The user connected Oura.
* Day 5: The user connected Apple HealthKit.
* Both Oura and HealthKit have been consistently sending sleep data every day since connected.

#### If your team priority states that Apple HealthKit > Oura

The query result would be:

* Day 1-4: Sleep Score computed from Oura sleep data
* Day 5-7: Sleep Score computed from Apple HealthKit sleep data

### If your team priority states that Oura > Apple HealthKit

The query result would be:

* Day 1-7: Sleep Score computed from Oura sleep data

<Info>
Apple HealthKit data are ignored in this case, because Oura is available throughout all
days and has higher provider priority.

## Previewing the prioritization effect

You can experiment and preview the effect of prioritization using the [Query API](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/using-query-api).

By specifying a list of provider slugs in `config.provider_priority_overrides`, you instruct the query executor to treat these providers
as the highest priority — above the team provider priority — specifically in this query invocation.


## Managing Provider Priorities

You can manage the provider priorities for each summary type through the **Data Priority** section of the [Junction Dashboard](https://app.junction.com/).

<Note>A larger number indicates a higher priority.</Note>


## Source Type Priorities

We use pre-assigned, non-configurable Source Type priorities that follow the general expectation of data reliability.

_(sorted from highest priority to lowest priority)_

* `lab`
* `automatic`
* `watch`
* `ring`
* `chest_strap`
* `scale`
* `cuff`
* `fingerprick`
* `manual_scan`
* `phone`
* `app`
* `multiple_sources`
* `unknown`
