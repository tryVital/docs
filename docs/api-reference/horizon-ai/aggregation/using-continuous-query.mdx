title: Using Continuous Query
---

You can subscribe to an [Aggregation Query](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/overview) by converting them
into a **Continuous Query**.

A Continuous Query:

* runs automatically across all users in your Team; and
* runs intelligently in the background, continuously monitoring for new data provider connections and user resource changes.
* pushes any query result changes as _Data Events_ to [your Webhook or ETL Pipeline destinations](/webhooks/introduction).

With Continuous Query, you can focus on adding value to your product with the aggregated data insights:

* you need not build your own scalable data pipeline from scratch to ingest, store and aggregate standardized device data.
* you need not poll the Query API to receive query results.


## Continuous Query requirements

While Continuous Query uses the same [Query DSL](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/) as the Query API, some
restrictions are in place:

* The query must [group by a truncated datetime](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/group-by-clause#group-by-a-truncated-datetime).
* The query must [select all group key columns](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/select-clause#select-the-group-key-columns).

<Note>
Do reach out to us if your use case is hampered by these restrictions.

## Managing your Continuous Queries

You can manage your Continuous Query using our [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management):

- [Create Continuous Query Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/create)
- [List Continuous Queries Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/list)

You can also manage them through the _Continuous Query_ section of the Vital Dashboard:
