title: Using Continuous Query
---

Continuous Queries are inherently an extension of queries written using the Aggregation Query DSL.
These are applied to the entire team and run continuously in the background, triggered only when data changes are detected.

You can manage your Continuous Query using our [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management):

- [Create Continuous Query Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/create)
- [List Continuous Queries Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/list)

<Info>
Continuos Query has to include at least one group_by expression and select all Group Key columns.
