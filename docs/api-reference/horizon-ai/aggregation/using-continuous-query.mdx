You can create a **Continuous Query** to have your [Horizon AI Query](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/overview)
automatically evaluated by Junction as needed, and receive any query result changes through [your Webhook or ETL Pipeline destinations](/webhooks/introduction).

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Automatic Evaluation" icon="wand-sparkles" defaultOpen>
Continuous Query runs automatically on all existing and new Users in your Team;
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Continuous Change Monitoring" icon="camera-cctv" defaultOpen>
Continuous Query is scheduled intelligently in response to any new data points or updates discovered through device data connections
made through [Junction Link](/wearables/connecting-providers/introduction) and [Junction Mobile SDKs](/wearables/sdks/vital-health).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Result Pushing" icon="webhook" defaultOpen>
Junction pushes any Continuous Query result table changes to your Webhook or ETL Pipeline destinations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Result Pulling" icon="table" defaultOpen>
The latest result table can be queried through [Junction API](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/get-result-table) at any time.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

With Continuous Query, you can focus on adding value to your product with the aggregated data insights:

* you need not build your own scalable data pipeline from scratch to ingest, store and aggregate standardized device data.
* you need not poll the Query API to receive query results.


## Continuous Query requirements

While Continuous Query uses the same [Query DSL](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/) as the Query API, some
restrictions are in place:

* The query must [group by a truncated datetime](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/group-by-clause#group-by-a-truncated-datetime).
* The query must [select all group key columns](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-dsl/select-clause#select-the-group-key-columns).

<Note>
Do reach out to us if your use case is hampered by these restrictions.

## Managing your Continuous Queries

You can manage your Continuous Query using our [Org Management API](/api-reference/org-management):

- [Create Continuous Query Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/create)
- [List Continuous Queries Endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/continuous-query/list)

You can also manage them through the _Continuous Query_ section of the Vital Dashboard:
