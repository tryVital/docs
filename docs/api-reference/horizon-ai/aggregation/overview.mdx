The Horizon AI Aggregation Query consolidates the multitude of user data collected across [wearable data providers](/wearables/providers/introduction)
and [source types](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type) into simple tabular outputs.

<Card title="Consolidation" icon="merge" horizontal>
Work with simple tabular outputs, and offload the dirty work to Horizon AI â€” the data gathering, prioritization and sanitization
processes across multiple providers and source types.

<Card title="Data prioritization" icon="bars-staggered" horizontal>
Provider priorities can be configured at team level. Query-level priority overrides are also supported to enable
experimentations.

Work with time zone agnostic outputs that are indexed in the user's perception of time (i.e., _floating time_).

## Aggregation API and Continuous Query

<Warning>
Aggregation API and Continuous Query are currently in closed beta.
The query schema and the behaviour is subject to change based on beta feedback.
</Warning>

The Horizon AI Aggregation Query can be utilised through two different solutions:

### Aggregation API

A real-time API enabling quick data analysis for individual users, offering:
- Flexible aggregation and arithmetic capabilities
- Dynamic query adjustment, making it ideal for interactive dashboards and data exploration

### Continuous Query

An automatic system running queries continuously in the background, which:
- Enables team-wide aggregations, triggered only as data changes are detected
- Is great for visualisation of results on known, mature aggregation queries
- Can push aggregation results to your webhook endpoints / ETL pipelines
