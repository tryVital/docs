The Horizon AI Aggregation API consolidates the multitude of user data collected across [wearable data providers](/wearables/providers/introduction)
and [source types](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type) into simple tabular outputs.

<Card title="Consolidation" icon="merge" horizontal>
Work with simple tabular outputs, and offload the dirty work to Horizon AI â€” the data gathering, prioritization and sanitization
processes across multiple providers and source types.
</Card>

<Card title="Data prioritization" icon="bars-staggered" horizontal>
Provider priorities can be configured at team level. Query-level priority overrides are also supported to enable
experimentations.

Work with time zone agnostic outputs that are indexed in the user's perception of time (i.e., _floating time_).

## How can I use Aggregation API?

<Warning>
Aggregation API is currently in closed beta.
The query schema and the behaviour is subject to change based on beta feedback.
</Warning>

You can make use of Vital Aggregation API through these channels:

| Channel | Remarks |
| ------- | ------- |
| [Vital Horizon AI Python SDK](/api-reference/horizon-ai/python-sdk/getting-started) | The `vitalx-aggregation` package provides an expressive Python Query DSL with [Polars DataFrame](https://pola.rs) integrations. |
| [Vital Aggregation API endpoint](/api-reference/horizon-ai/aggregation/query-one) | JSON API calls. |
| [Typed bindings of Vital API](/home/libraries) | Call the Aggregation API in Go, Java, Node and Python. |
