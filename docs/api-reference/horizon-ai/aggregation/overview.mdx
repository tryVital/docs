The Horizon AI Aggregation Query consolidates the multitude of user data collected across [wearable data providers](/wearables/providers/introduction)
and [source types](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type) into simple tabular outputs.

<Card title="Consolidation" icon="merge" horizontal>
Work with simple tabular outputs, and offload the dirty work to Horizon AI — the data gathering, prioritization and sanitization
processes across multiple providers and source types.
</Card>

<Card title="Data prioritization" icon="bars-staggered" horizontal>
Provider priorities can be configured at team level. Query-level priority overrides are also supported to enable
experimentations.

<Card title="Aggregate in floating time" icon="timeline-arrow" horizontal>
Work with time zone agnostic outputs that are indexed in the user's perception of time (i.e., _floating time_).

## Query API and Continuous Query

<Warning>
Query API and Continuous Query are currently in closed beta.
The query schema and the behaviour is subject to change based on beta feedback.
</Warning>

You can use Horizon AI Aggregation Query through two mediums:

### Query API
* Rapid Insights: Ideal for quick analysis, allowing developers to experiment with individual user data immediately.
* Flexible Outputs: Produces easy-to-use DataFrames that work seamlessly with popular data analysis tools.
* Cost and Time Efficiency: Get aggregated insights without having to dump all user data from the API.
* Build Dynamic Dashboards: Queries are adjustable and executed in real time, suitable for dynamic dashboards that need to support flexible adjustments of query based on user inputs.

### Continuous Query
* Automatic Evaluation: Best suited for scenarios requiring ongoing data monitoring and updates, automatically re-evaluating queries when new data is available.
* Streamlined Workflows: Minimizes manual effort and efficiently manages large datasets, making it ideal for continuous reporting and collaboration within teams.
* Pushed Changes: New and changed query results are pushed to you as webhooks via svix or ETL Pipelines

### Decision Guide
<Steps>
<Step title="Experiment with Query API">
    Start with Query API if you need quick insights, one-time analysis or query experimentation using an individual user's data.
</Step>
<Step title="Productize with Continuous Query">
    Switch to Continuous Query once you have queries which you wish to turn into a continuously updated, named dataset and to receive change events for.
</Step>
</Steps>
Choose based on your current needs — rapid analysis and iteration with Query API or continual data monitoring with Continuous Query. Both features use the same Query DSL, complement each other and can adapt as your product evolves.
