<Note>
The [`vital` PyPI package](/home/libraries)  (Vital API Python SDK) provides typed bindings
of the Vital API in Python that tracks our OpenAPI Schema.

Horizon AI Python SDK is a standalone product offering, separately from the `vital` PyPI package.
</Note>

**Horizon AI Python SDK** bridges Vital's data aggregation and intelligence capabilities with the
rich Python ecosystem for scientific computing and data analysis.

## Authentication

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Deployed Services" icon="server" defaultOpen>
Use the same [Vital API Keys](/api-details/authentication#server-to-server) your system used to interact with Vital API.

To set the Vital API Key for the Horizon AI Python SDK, you can:
* Pass the Vital API Key explicitly to the Horizon AI SDK entity's constructor (e.g., the Query Executor); or
* Set the Vital API Key as the `VITAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Scientists and Developers" icon="user" defaultOpen>
Sign-in locally on your machine with your [Junction Dashboard](https://app.junction.com/) account. You can
do so through the [Horizon AI SDK Command Line Tool](#sdk-command-line-tool) as detailed below.

## Installation

### Aggregation API

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a dependency">
Add the `vitalx-aggregation` package to your project.

```bash
poetry add vitalx-aggregation
```
</Step>

</Steps>

### SDK Command Line Tool

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a dependency">
Add the `vitalx-cli` package as a dev dependency to your project.

```bash
poetry add -G dev vitalx-cli
```
</Step>

<Step title="Start the device authentication process">
Create the `~/.vitalx` directory, and grant it execute permission. The SDK requires execute
permission to maintain a file lock.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vitalx && chmod +x ~/.vitalx
```

Call the `auth login` CLI subcommand on the `vitalx-cli` package to start the authentication
process.

```bash
poetry run vitalx-cli auth login
```

</Step>

<Step title="Sign in with your Junction Dashboard account">
You would be prompted in your default web browser to sign-in to the [Junction Dashboard](https://app.junction.com/).
You will then be asked to confirm the device authorization.

</Step>

<Step title="Voila!">
You have now signed-in. You can now use any Horizon AI SDK entity without a Vital API Key.

<Note>
Your permanent session is stored at `~/.vitalx/`.

## Example

[tryvital/vitalx-notebook](https://github.com/tryVital/vitalx-notebook) is a pre-configured Jupyter Notebook project
with dependencies on Aggregation API and SDK Command Line Tool pre-configured.

The notebook also includes an example to compute _Chronotypes_ using the Aggregation API.
