<Warning>
By setting a higher value, you acknowledge your awareness of _the facts of API life_ that:

1. historical pulls may take longer to complete;
2. historical pulls may run into provider rate limiting; and
3. regular data polling may consequentially be delayed as a knock-on effect.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Provider rate limiting typically happens at OAuth application level.

Therefore, Vital recommends [Bring Your Own OAuth](/wearables/connecting-providers/bring_your_own_oauth)
if you want to set an extended historical pull range. This creates a rate limit quota dedicated to
your Vital Team, not being shared with other Vital customers.
</Warning>

<Info>
The Team Data Pull Preferences you specified is _advisory_. There are scenarios in which Vital systems
may not adhere strictly to your stated preferences.
