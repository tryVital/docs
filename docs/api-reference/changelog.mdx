### Vital API

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="User Undo Deletion" icon="trash-undo" iconType="solid">
        You can now undo user deletion that is still in the 7-day grace period.

        Check out the [User Undo Deletion](/api-reference/user/undo-delete-user) endpoint documentation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Fallback Birth Date for Heart Rate Zones" icon="cake-candles" iconType="solid">
        You can now set a Fallback Birth Date on a user. Vital can use this to compute a more accurate
        workout Heart Rate Zones, when the provider exposes neither heart rate zones nor age to Vital.

        Check out the [Heart Rate Zones](/wearables/providers/heart-rate-zones#fallback-birth-date) documentation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Grouped Timeseries" icon="chart-scatter" iconType="solid">
        You can now get grouped timeseries data.
        This initial release groups data by [Source Type](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type)
        from [supported providers](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#supported-providers).

        Check out the [Blood Oxygen](/api-reference/timeseries-grouped/blood-oxygen) endpoint documentation for an example.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Historical Pull Introspection" icon="binoculars" iconType="solid">
        You can now introspect the status of all one-off user historical data pulls. It also provides a
        rough estimate of the amount of data ingested (in terms of "days with data").

        Check out the [Historical Pull Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/historical-pulls) endpoint documentation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="User Resources Introspection" icon="binoculars" iconType="solid">
        You can now introspect user data ingestion statistics. For example, the endpoint provides:
        1. Oldest and newest data timestamp
        2. The number of objects sent in `*.created` events
        3. The status and time of the last ingestion attempt (polling or push)

        Check out the [User Resources Introspection](/api-reference/introspection/user-resources) endpoint documentation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Vital Sign-In Token for Mobile SDKs" icon="id-badge" iconType="solid">
        [Vital Sign-In Token](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) is a new SDK Authentication scheme
        that grants only user-scoped access to your mobile app sign-ins. This allows you to keep your Vital API Keys
        as server-side secrets.

        Check out the [SDK Authentication](/wearables/sdks/authentication#vital-sign-in-token) guide on how to migrate to
        this scheme. Check out the [Create Sign-In Token](/api-reference/user/create-sign-in-token) endpoint documentation
        on how to generate tokens for your mobile app sign-ins.

### Provider Data

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Expanded Source Type attribution" icon="tag" iconType="solid">
        Data from Fitbit, Oura, Garmin and Freestyle Libre
        now provide [Source Type attributions](/wearables/providers/data-attributions#source-type).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Freestyle Libre in floating time" icon="clock" iconType="solid">
        Vital now reports timeseries data from Freestyle Libre in [floating time](/wearables/providers/timestamps-and-time-zones#timestamps).
        
        Though some older teams would receive the `+00:00` time zone specifier for compatibility. We encourage these teams to add
        support the floating time format. Once done, you can contact support to remove the `+00:00` misnomer.

        Check out the [Timestamps and Time Zones](/wearables/providers/timestamps-and-time-zones) documentation for more information.
